<h2>The Potency of the Jewish Race</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Charles W. Eliot</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote" style="width: 160px;">

<i><big>C</big>HARLES WILLIAM ELIOT (born
in Boston, 1834), pre&euml;minent as
educator and publicist; for forty
years President of Harvard University;
revered not only by Harvard men
but by all Americans as a great leader
of thought and opinion. Dr. Eliot
warmly welcomed the organization of
the first Menorah Society at Harvard,
in 1906; and to his encouragement is
due in large measure the growth of the
Menorah movement. At a time when
the problems and lessons of the war are
absorbing his attention, Dr. Eliot has
generously shown his continued sympathy
with the Menorah aims and his interest
in the Menorah Journal by preparing
this article.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>F</big>OR many centuries the Jews have had
no country of their own or even national
headquarters. They have been
scattered among many nations, all more or
less unfriendly, and some cruelly oppressive;
yet they have retained, under the most adverse
circumstances, the capacity to earn their
livelihood, to bring up families, and to maintain
the great traditions of their race. The
main reason for the indestructibility of the
Jews is that they early embraced certain invaluable
ideals, and have struggled towards
them indomitably for thousands of years.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Races and Ideals</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE principal difference between races
is difference of ideals. Whenever several
distinct races come to live side by side on
the same territory in the bonds of a peaceful
and co&ouml;perative fellowship for all common
public purposes, it will be found that they
have all reached common political and social
ideals, although in regard to many racial
attributes and even in regard to religious
beliefs they remain distinct.</div>

<p>The assimilation of different races can be
brought about only by a gradual acceptance of the same ideals and aspirations.
For several centuries this process of assimilation has been going on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
in many parts of the earth, and is now going on at an accelerated pace,
resulting in larger conceptions of nationality and larger political or governmental
units.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Influence of Lofty Ideals on the Jewish Race</i></div>
<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE Jewish race affords the strongest instance of the influence on a
human stock of lofty ideals, persistently held wherever on the face
of the earth a fragment of the race has planted itself. In all generations
and in all environments the Jews have succeeded in competition with other
races to a remarkable degree. Among a poor population they are less
poor than their neighbors; among a free and prosperous population the
Jews become richer and more prosperous than the average. Confined in
unwholesome Ghettos, they retain to an astonishing degree their health
and vitality, helped doubtless by the dietary and sanitary directions given
in their ancient Scriptures. Deprived of the right to bear arms in many
countries, and, therefore, unable to resist savage attack, they remain inextinguishable.
Wherever they become prosperous they develop an extraordinary
community feeling, and take care of their own poor or unfortunate.
In short, in all generations and in all their various environments they have
exhibited, and still exhibit, a remarkable racial tenacity and vigor. It is
manifest that this normal success of the race is not due to any especially
favorable material conditions, but to the rare strength and significance of
its ideals.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>"The Noblest of Human Ideals": Jewish Monotheism</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>W</big>HAT are these ideals? What have they been for thousands of years?
The first of the Jewish ideals has been that of one God&mdash;the
noblest of all human ideals&mdash;early attained, and persistently clung to by
the whole race. Mohammedan monotheism is noble, and is the main source
of the strength of those races which have embraced the religion of Mahomet;
but the Mohammedan doctrine of One God arrived thousands of
years after the Jewish, and never was so pure. The most significant sentence
in the English speech is the first sentence of the Hebrew Bible&mdash;"In
the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." That is the first of
the Jewish ideals, to which the race has been true in all environments, in
weal and in woe; and that belief has delivered it from many sorts of enfeebling
and degrading terrors and superstitions.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Ideal of the Family</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>NOTHER Jewish ideal which has counted for much in the history of the
race is the ideal of the family&mdash;pure, honorable, and sacred. The
veneration of ancestors, which has been an important part of the religion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
China and Japan, is only an undue exaggeration of the Hebrew commandment,
"Honor thy father and thy mother." The Jewish race has seen
fulfilled the promise which is the last phrase of that commandment, "that
thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,"
although in many lands and not in any land of their own. The organized
human society most likely to prove durable or permanent is that which
possesses and maintains in theory and practise a lofty ideal of the family.
The reverence shown by children toward their parents and the devotion of
parents to their children, which prevail in Jewish families, are both more
intense than is usual in Christian families. These sentiments yield infinite
good in any human society; they produce, and pass on from generation
to generation, purity of life, family honor, and a real consecration of the
best human affections. That is the second potent Jewish ideal.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Ethical Ideal of the Ten Commandments</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE third effective ideal is the ethical teaching contained in the Ten
Commandments, the most compact and yet comprehensive code of
morals ever written. These ethical principles have been held before the
Jewish race for thousands of years wherever it has lived, in good times
and bad, an ideal toward which the race has always struggled, though with
frequent lapses. This code contains the institution of the Sabbath Day,
which by itself accounts for much of the extraordinary endurance of the
race.</div>

<p>The Jews have always been distinguished for their respect for learning
and their zeal for education. In the Ghettos of Europe, under the
most discouraging conditions, their Rabbis kept alive the ancient learning,
and through many centuries gave the elite of the rising generation
some mental training, when no instruction was to be had by the masses of
mankind. A persecuted race, provided it retains its vitality and elasticity,
receives admirable training in loyalty to its ideals. In the case of the Jews
this was a loyalty not only to race, but to religion; and religious loyalty
is the finest and most sustaining of all loyalties. The religion of the Jews
emphasizes an ideal to which the Jewish mind and heart have responded
ardently from the earliest times&mdash;the ideal of righteousness. Loyalty to
this ideal includes loyalty to race, family, religion, and all righteous persons.
The Jews believe that righteousness alone exalteth a nation, a family,
or a man.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Will the Jewish Race Meet the Test of Liberty?</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>F</big>OR two thousand years the Jews have led their daily lives under exposure
to bodily harm, injustice, and all sorts of disaster, and under
such grievous trials have preserved their ideals. The race is now to be
put to another and severer test. In the free countries of Europe and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
America the Jews enjoy complete political and industrial liberty. They
were for centuries excluded from most professions, arts, and industries,
and were driven into trade and money-lending. Now all callings are open
to them. In the Middle Ages there were only a few directions in which a
successful Jew could safely spend his money. Now he can spend it in any
direction&mdash;wisely and beneficently, or foolishly and ostentatiously. Will
the race bear liberty as well as it has borne oppression? The liberty,
which is the only atmosphere in which the strongest men and women can
develop, often causes the downfall of weak-willed human beings. Rich
Jews, like other rich people, are in danger of becoming luxurious&mdash;the
more so because the race has been cut off from military service, and has
not been addicted to out-of-door sports. The worst destroyer of sound
family and national life is luxury. If the race is to meet successfully the
test of liberty, it will get over its apparent tendency of the moment towards
materialism and reliance on the power of money, hold fast to its social and
artistic idealism, and press steadily towards its intellectual and religious
ideals.</div>

<h2>Israel and Medicine</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Sir William Osler</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote" style="width: 152px;">
<img src="images/2wosler.jpg" width="152" height="200" alt="SIR WILLIAM OSLER" title="SIR WILLIAM OSLER" />
<i><big>S</big>IR WILLIAM OSLER
(born in Ontario, Canada,
in 1849) Regius Professor of
Medicine at Oxford and one of
the world's leading medical
authorities; distinguished not
merely as investigator, teacher,
and practitioner, but also as
essayist and ethical teacher of
singular grace and humanity,
as shown in the volumes entitled
"Aequanimitas" and
"Counsels and Ideals." The
present address, delivered in
London at the twenty-fifth anniversary
of the Jewish Historical
Society of England, is here
given its first publication in
this country, with Sir William's
special authorization.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>N estimating the position of Israel in the human
values we must remember that the quest for
righteousness is Oriental, the quest for knowledge
Occidental. With the great prophets of the
East&mdash;Moses, Isaiah, Mahomet&mdash;the word was,
"Thus saith the Lord"; with the great seers of the
West, from Thales and Aristotle to Archimedes and
Lucretius, it was "What says Nature?" They illustrate
two opposite views of man and his destiny&mdash;in
the one he is an "<i>angelus sepultus</i>" in a
muddy vesture of decay; in the other, he is the
"young light-hearted master" of the world, in it to
know it, and by knowing to conquer. Modern civilization
is the outcome of these two great movements
of the mind of man, who to-day is ruled in heart and
head by Israel and by Greece. From the one he has
learned responsibility to a Supreme Being, and the
love of his neighbor, in which are embraced both the
Law and the Prophets; from the other he has gathered
the promise of Eden to have dominion over the
earth on which he lives. Not that Israel is all heart,
nor Greece all head, for in estimating the human
value of the two races, intellect and science are found
in Jerusalem and beauty and truth at Athens, but in
different proportions.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Medicine in the Talmud</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>T is a striking fact that there is no great Oriental name in science&mdash;not
one to be put in the same class with Aristotle, with Hippocrates, or
with a score of Grecians. We do not go to the Bible for science, though
we may go to Moses for instruction in some of the best methods in hygiene.
Nor is the Talmud a fountain-head in which men seek inspiration to-day
as in the works of Aristotle. I do not forget the saying:</div>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="In uns'rem Talmud kann man Jedes lesen">
<tr><td align='left'>"<i>In uns'rem Talmud kann man Jedes lesen,</i></td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><span style="margin-left: .5em;"><i>Und Alles ist schon einmal dagewesen</i>."</span></td></tr>
</table></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>With much of intense interest for the physician, and in spite of some brave
sayings about the value of science, there is not in it the spirit of Aristotle
or of Galen. It is true we find there one of the earliest instances in literature
of an accurate diagnosis confirmed <i>post mortem</i>. A sheep of the
Rabbi Chabiba had paralysis of the hind legs. Rabbi Jemar diagnosed
ischias, or arthritis, but Rabbina, who was called in, said that the disease
was in the spinal marrow. To settle the dispute the sheep was killed, and
Rabbina's diagnosis was confirmed.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Role of Jewish Physicians in the Middle Ages</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>N the early Middle Ages the Jewish physicians played a role of the first
importance as preservers and transmitters of ancient knowledge. With
the fall of Rome the broad stream of Greek science in western Europe
entered the sud of medi&aelig;valism. It filtered through in three streams&mdash;one
in South Italy, the other in Byzantium, and a third through Islam.
At the great school of Salernum in the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries,
we find important Jewish teachers; Copho II wrote the Anatomia
Porci, and Rebecca wrote on fevers and the f&oelig;tus. Jews were valued councillors
at the court of the great Emperor Frederick. With the Byzantine
stream the Jews seem to have had little to do, but the broad, clear stream
which ran through Islam is dotted thickly with Hebrew names. In the
eastern and western Caliphates and in North Africa were men who to-day
are the glory of Israel, and bright stars in the medical firmament. Three
of these stand out pre&euml;minent. The writings of Isaac Jud&aelig;us, known in
the Middle Ages as Monarcha Medicorum, were prized for more than four
centuries. He had a Hippocratic belief in the powers of nature and in the
superiority of prevention to cure. He was an optimist and held strongly
to the Talmudic precept that the physician who takes nothing is worth
nothing. Rabbi ben Ezra was a universal genius and wanderer, whose
travels brought him as far as England. His philosophy of life Browning
has depicted in the well-known poem, whose beauty of diction and clarity
of thought atone for countless muddy folios.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Maimonides: Prince Among Physicians</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>B</big>UT the prince among Jewish physicians, whose fame as such has been
overshadowed by his reputation as a Talmudist and philosopher, is
the Doctor Perplexorum&mdash;<i>dux, director, demonstrator, neutrorum dubitantium
et errantium!</i>&mdash;Moses Maimonides. Cordova boasts of three of
the greatest names in the history of Arabian medicine: Avenzoar, Albucasis,
and Averroes (Avenzoar is indeed claimed to be a Jew). Great as is the
fame of Averroes as the commentator and transmitter of Aristotle to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
scholastic Europe, his fame is enhanced as the teacher and inspirer of
Moses ben Maimon. Exiled from Spain, this great teacher became in
Egypt the Thomas Aquinas of Jewry, the conciliator of the Bible and the
Talmud with the philosophy of Aristotle. He remains one of Israel's great
prophets, and while devoted to theology and philosophy, he was a distinguished
and successful practitioner of medicine and the author of many
works highly prized for nearly five centuries, some of which are still
reprinted. He says pathetically, "Although from my youth Torah was
betrothed to me and continues to live by me as the wife of my youth, in
whose love I find a constant delight, strange women, whom I took at first
into my house as her handmaids, have become her rivals and absorbed part
of my time." The spirit of the man is manifest in his famous prayer, one
of the precious documents of our profession, worthy to be placed beside
the Hippocratic oath. It ends with: "In suffering let me always see only
my fellow creature."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Jewish Physicians and Medieval Popes</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>N the revival of learning in the thirteenth century, which led to the foundation
of so many of the universities, Hebrew physicians took a prominent
part, particularly in the great schools of Montpelier and of Paris;
and for the next two or three centuries in Italy, in France, and in Germany,
Hebrew physicians were greatly prized. But too often the tribulations
of Israel were their lot. As one reads of the grievous persecutions they
suffered, there comes to mind the truth of Zunz' words: "<i>Wenn es eine
Stufenleiter von Leiden giebt, so hat Israel die hochste Staffel erstiegen.</i>"
Their checkered career is well illustrated by the relations with the Popes,
some of whom uttered official bulls and fulminations against them, others
seem to have had a special fondness for them as body physicians. Paul III
was for years in charge of Jacob Montino, a distinguished Jewish physician,
who translated extensively from the Arabic and Hebrew into Latin,
and his edition of Averroes is dedicated to Pope Leo X. In my library
there is a copy of the letter of Pope Gregory XIII, dated March 30th,
1581, and printed in 1584, confirming the decrees of Paul IV and Pius V,
which he regrets were by no means held in observance, "but that there are
still many among Christian persons who desiring the infirmities of their
bodies be cured by illicit means, and especially by the service of Jews and
other infidels.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." It was at Mantua that a Jewish physician, Abraham
Conath, established a printing press, from which the first Hebrew
works were issued.</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><br /><i>Names of Distinction in Later Centuries</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HROUGHOUT the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries in
France, Germany, and Italy we meet many distinguished names in
the profession, and in his <i>Geschichte der J&uuml;dischen Aertz</i> Landau pays a
very just tribute to their work. Only a few are met with in England.
Isaac Abendana, a Spaniard, practised in Oxford and lectured on Hebrew
at Magdalen College. We have at the Bodleian Jewish almanacs which lie
issued at the end of the seventeenth century, and a great Latin translation
of Mishnah. He afterwards migrated to Cambridge. A more important
author was Jacob de Castro Sarmento, a Portuguese Jew, who became
licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1725, and Fellow of the
Royal Society in 1730. There is in the Bodleian an interesting broadsheet
from the Register of the London Synagogues respecting charges made
when his name was proposed at the Royal Society. He contributed many
papers to the Philosophical Transactions, and was the author of several
works. In the eighteenth century Jean Baptiste de Silva, of a Portuguese
Jewish family, became one of the leading physicians of Paris, consulting
physician to Louis XV, and the friend of Voltaire, who remarks, "<i>C'&eacute;tait
un de ces m&eacute;decins que Moliere n'eut ni pu ni os&eacute; rendre ridicules</i>." One of
the special treasures of my library is a volume of the Henriade superbly
bound by Padeloup, and a presentation copy from Voltaire to de Silva,
given me when I left Baltimore by my messmates in "The Ship of Fools"
(a dining club). Voltaire's inscription reads as follows:</div>

<p>"<i>A Monsieur Silva, Esculape Fran&ccedil;ois. Recevez cet hommage de votre
fr&egrave;re en Apollon. Ce Dieu vous a laiss&eacute; son plus bel h&eacute;ritage, tous les
Dons de l'esprit, tous ceux de la raison, et je n'eus que des Vers, h&eacute;las, pour
mon partage.</i>"</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Achievement of Recent Years</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>N the nineteenth century, with the removal of the vexatious restrictions,
the Jew had a chance of reaching his full development, and he has
taken a position in the medical profession comparable to that occupied in
the palmy Arabian days of Cordova and Bagdad. In Germany particularly,
the last half of the century witnessed a remarkable outburst of
scientific activity. Traube, who may well be called the father of experimental
pathology; Henle, the distinguished anatomist and pathologist;
Valentin, the physiologist; Lebert, Remak, Romberg, Ebstein, Henoch,
have been among the clinical physicians of the very first rank. Cohnheim
was the most brilliant pathologist of his day; to Weigert pathological histology
owes an enormous debt, and, to crown all, the man whose ideas have
revolutionized modern pathology, Paul Ehrlich, is a Jew. In America<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Hebrew members of our profession for many years occupied a very prominent
position. The father of the profession to-day, a man universally
beloved, is Abraham Jacobi, full of years and honors; and the two most
brilliant representatives in physiology and pathology, Simon Flexner and
Jacques Loeb, carry out the splendid traditions of Traube and Henle.</div>

<p>I have always had a warm affection for my Jewish students, and the
friendships I have made with them have been among the special pleasures
of my life. Their success has always been a great gratification, as it has
been the just reward of earnestness and tenacity of purpose and devotion
to high ideals in science; and, I may add, a dedication of themselves as
practitioners to everything that could promote the welfare of their
patients. In the medical profession the Jews had a long and honorable
record, and among no people is all that is best in our science and art more
warmly appreciated; none in the community take more to heart the admonition
of the son of Sirach, "Give place to the physician, let him not go
from thee, for thou hast need of him."</p>

<h2>The War from a Jewish Standpoint</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Richard Gottheil</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote" style="width: 132px;">
<img src="images/3rgottheil.jpg" width="132" height="200" alt="RICHARD GOTTHEIL" title="RICHARD GOTTHEIL" />
<i><big>R</big>ICHARD GOTTHEIL

has been a leader in America
from the beginning. He was
among the first to extend an
encouraging hand to the Menorah
movement and has responded
generously to repeated
calls to lecture before Menorah
Societies. The present article is
based upon an address recently
delivered before the Cornell
Menorah Society.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE war in Europe presents problems for
the Jews which must be faced no matter
what the consequences may be. These
problems are of two kinds, due to the fact that we
are members of a race that is scattered over the
whole earth, and the units of which are to be found
in the four corners of the globe. In this way a
double set of duties is entailed upon us. On the
one hand, we have to take our rightful place as citizens
of the different countries in which we live: to
accept all the burdens that go with such citizenship,
and to partake of the joys and sorrows that
are its inevitable accompaniment&mdash;in a word, to
take the advice of the Rabbis of old and "seek the
welfare" of the country in which we live. But this
obligation is so self-evident, and the problems
raised by it solve themselves so naturally, that they
need no further thought. In point of fact, the
patriotism of the Jews for the lands in which they
live has been demonstrated on so many occasions
that only blind ignorance or wilful misrepresentation
can call it into question. At the present moment,
in all the armies that are at the front, our
brethren are doing service even beyond their numerical
proportion.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Toll Paid by the Jew</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>T is to the second set of problems that I venture
to call attention&mdash;those Jewish problems
that concern ourselves in particular, that deal with our relations
to and with our fellow Jews&mdash;problems which I am afraid are not
always present in our minds. For one reason or another, they are apt
to be forgotten, to slip into the background through sheer negligence. Indeed,
in many cases we are fain to put them intentionally into a corner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and remove them discreetly from sight. It has needed a great world event
at this time, as it has in the past, to bring many of us to reason and to a
realization of our duty. The titanic struggle in which so many of the
nations of the world are engaged has come to remind us also of our position
as Jews and to recall to us our relations with the past, our connections with
the present, and our hopes for the future. It is indeed true that none of
the great political movements that have affected the world have passed by
without in some special manner affecting the Jewish people. As we look
back through history and allow our thoughts to run down the highway of
the ages, we perceive the effects such struggles have had upon the Jew. We
think of the time when ancient Babylonia stretched out its arm from the
East to gain a foothold on the Mediterranean and to grasp the power of the
world. What was the effect upon the Jews? The Babylonian captivity.
Many hundreds of years after, Rome&mdash;the Babylonia of the West&mdash;lunged
out toward the East in the same search for universal dominion; and we still
observe the Ninth of Ab in commemoration of the destruction of the Temple
at Jerusalem. Again some centuries passed us by, and we come to the inevitable
conflict between Christianity and the rising power of Islam. Who
was it but our own Jews who suffered most as the crusading hordes moved
through Europe&mdash;our own Jews who were driven before them from the
Rhine into what at a later time became the great national Ghetto in Poland?
And now in this twentieth century, as a people, and in proportion to its
numbers, which body of men, women and children is paying the most exacting
toll to the forces of destiny? Again it is the Jew.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>"The Belgians of All History"</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>W</big>E all have the greatest possible sympathy for the Belgian people and
for the Belgian land. Yet how much greater has been the suffering
of the Jewish people&mdash;the Belgians not of a day but of all history? In
Eastern Europe, in Poland, in Galicia and in parts of Russia, at least two
or three millions of Jews have suffered from the ravages of a war waged
with a bitterness that exceeds all bounds. Invading armies have passed and
re-passed over their homes&mdash;miserable as they were even in times of peace.
False accusations have been launched against them so that they have been
regarded as enemies by both sides and treated as such. Thousands have
been driven from their homes to congest villages already filled to overflowing
or to increase the want and suffering indigenous to towns and cities.
An amount of anguish and pain has been caused such as the Jews have
never known in all their long tramp through the ages. What have we done,
we Jews in America, to assuage even a part of this pain? What measures
have we in view, when once the war shall be over, to regain for these people
the possibility of living, to bring back for them a little of that which they
have lost through no fault of their own and in no cause which is theirs? In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
most cases the only right permitted to them is the right to suffer, and they
must in addition pay the price of that suffering. As we think of all these
circumstances, is it not proper and meet that we should ponder the whole
situation in which we Jews find ourselves today?</div>

<p>I believe that it is eminently the moment to do so. We refuse to believe
that the great waste of human life and energy now going on in Europe
is a waste pure and simple. We refuse to believe that some purification is
not to result from the fire through which mankind is passing, and that some
sanity in handling human affairs is not to follow the evident insanity with
which we are now confronted. Something a little more stable because a
little more reasonable must appear at the end to replace the inconstancy
and unrest which have up to now characterized the relations of peoples to
each other. And as we hope this for the world at large, we are hopeful too
that full attention will be given to those problems which concern the Jews
specifically. I wish then to indicate the chief among these problems, in
order that we may ourselves see clearly the road that must be taken.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Prospect in Russia and Poland</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>F</big>IRST and foremost, of course, rank the questions that concern the
Jews in Russia. Quite apart from any consideration of the general
problems affecting that country, the case of the Jews in Russia and Poland
demands a settlement that shall make existence bearable for them, and
which at the same time shall not run counter to the real and vital interests
of the Russian people. Nay more; such existence must not only be bearable.
It must be of a kind that will place the Jews upon a level with the
other inhabitants of the Empire and will give them the necessary opportunity
to develop whatever talents or capabilities they possess. It is not
for us to prescribe in what manner and by what means this shall be accomplished;
and I use the word "must" not in the sense that any compulsion
is to be applied to Russia in this respect, but rather as an expression of
the certainty that the trial through which the Czar's land is now passing is
of such a kind as to purge her necessarily of all traces of national and
religious intolerance. This feeling cannot be expressed in better words than
those used by M. Bourtzeff, the well-known reactionary, when he said, "We
are convinced that after this war there will no longer be any room for
political reaction and Russia will be associated with the existing group of
cultured and civilized countries."</div>

<p>Proof that such feelings are making their way among the most intelligent
portion of the Russian population is shown by the remarkable
document put forth some weeks ago over the signatures of noted Christian
professors, litterateurs, and members of the Duma, in which the plea is made
for the removal of all restrictions that at present shackle the Jews. "Let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
us understand," they say, "that the welfare and the power of Russia are
inseparably bound up with the welfare and liberties of all the nationalities
that constitute the whole Empire. Let us then conceive this truth. Let
us act in accordance with our intelligence and our conscience, and then we
are sure that the disappearance of all kinds of persecution of the Jews and
their complete emancipation, so as to be our equals in all rights of citizenship,
will form one of the conditions of a real constructive imperial policy."
And we are the more persuaded that these views will prevail when we remember
that Russia has been brought into closer contact with just those
nations of Europe where Jewish emancipation has been most perfect and
has brought forth the best fruits. It is unthinkable that these nations
should fail to put their influence on the side of Jewish freedom in Russia
when European accounts are finally balanced.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Broken Faith of Roumania</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>N the second place, any regulation of the Jewish status in Europe must
of necessity include Roumania. The injustice of the Government's
attitude in that country is even more pronounced than it is in Russia. For
Roumania is bound to a certain course by a "scrap of paper." At the Berlin
Congress of 1878, one of the conditions upon which statehood was granted
to Roumania was that the rights of free citizenship should be conferred
upon the Jewish inhabitants in the principality&mdash;who, it may be remarked
in passing, were among the oldest residents there. Roumania gave her solemn
promise to carry out this condition; but by political subterfuge of the
most brazen kind she has circumvented the whole spirit of the demand. The
Roumanian Chamber passed a law to the effect that only Jews who had been
naturalized by it were entitled to citizenship; and as the Chamber refused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to naturalize more than a handful each year, the provisions of the Berlin
Treaty have been as good as void. When quite recently&mdash;in 1913&mdash;during
the progress of the last Balkan War and prior to the intervention of Roumania,
the Roumanian Jews volunteered to serve in large numbers, the proposal
was brought forward to grant the rights of citizenship to all Jews
who had entered the army. Yet this proposal was voted down; and the
condition of the Jews has remained as it was prior to 1878. They are inhabitants
in a country, subject to its laws, liable to all duties placed upon
citizens&mdash;but they are themselves prohibited from becoming citizens. It is
intolerable that such a condition should be allowed to continue; and if right
is to take the place of might in the inevitable re-arrangement of the community
of European nations, the status of the Roumanian Jews must be
one of the Jewish problems to be solved.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Hope of Regaining Palestine</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HERE is a third Jewish problem the importance of which perhaps
even transcends the two just mentioned; transcends because of the
interest that attaches to it and because of its vital import to every Jew the
world over. I refer to the problem of Palestine, which is wrapt up with
the very existence of the Jews and which symbolizes the hopes that have
been nurtured throughout the centuries. We know that the Jew in his inevitable
march westward has kept his face turned towards the East; that in
prayer and in meditation his gaze has rested upon that country which
enshrined at one and the same time his origin and his future aspirations.
It is true that up to within some forty years that aspiration remained in
large part a pious wish; and that though it was cherished as coming to
realization "quickly and in our day," very few attempts were put through
to arm the Almighty with human effort. At best, God-fearing and pious
Jews removed to Palestine, either to immerse themselves there in study and
contemplation, or to end their days in the odor of sanctity.</div>

<p>But the last twenty-five years have witnessed a conscious effort to
make of Palestine a rallying point for the Jewish people, a place where
Jewish life may be lived to its fullest extent and which may serve as a
beacon light to all parts of the Diaspora. Many a waste place has been
made to blossom again; and much of the culture and learning acquired by
the Jews in the long centuries of toil and effort has been made available
to revivify the Land of Promise. With infinite pains and untold sacrifices
the Jewish pioneers went forward in their peaceful effort to regain the soil
of their forefathers. Colonies have been founded there; primary schools,
high schools and technical institutions have been established, and many of
the forces have been started that make the foundation for a permanent
settlement. This conscious effort can not have been put forth in vain.
Palestine represents the goal of our endeavor. And any settlement after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the war that has in view the general problems involved will be forced to
take cognizance of the just hopes that we Jews place in the future of that
country and the just rights that the Jewish people believe they possess and
have acquired there. The form in which such rights shall be expressed is
not a matter for discussion at present. The fact alone is of importance.
In the past the world has applauded the fight made by the Poles for their
national existence; it has followed with interest the Greek War of Independence,
the Italian striving for unity, the Irish endeavors for racial
autonomy, and the Alsatian effort after independent expression. It must
and will appreciate and esteem the attempt made by the Jews to re-fashion
their anomalous status and to re-create the statehood that they lost nearly
two thousand years ago.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Collapse of Principles Held Sacred by the Jews</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>O</big>UR concern, however, in the present world conflict goes further than
our own immediate affairs, and meets those interests which we have
in common with the rest of humankind. Much as we deplore the wanton
destruction of property, much as we bewail the reckless loss of life, we
mourn especially the diminution of ethical standards and the perversion of
our whole outlook on life. For this means the lapse of much for which our
own teachers have stood, the forfeit of many a principle which has been
dear to the Jewish heart. Let me touch lightly upon three points out of
the many that come to mind.</div>

<p>First of all, what we must deplore most is the defiance to law and to
its reign which has become so marked a characteristic during the present
war. The agreements arrived at in conventions, the bases of treaties, the
binding character of compacts, and the sanctity of engagements&mdash;all seem
to have been thrown into one melting pot. The mere fact that the expression
"a scrap of paper" has become a household word, bandied about by
orators and scribblers, shows the distance we have descended into the abyss.
The whole structure of our international relations seems to have fallen to
the ground and the labored work of centuries to have been undone in a few
months. Now, the Jews have been from the earliest times a people that
have laid the greatest possible stress upon the rule of law; so much so,
that their own laws were supposed to have divine sanction. In olden Jewish
times everything was regulated by law&mdash;man's relation to his fellow men,
to the state, and to God; to such a degree that we have been blamed often
for being a law-ridden people. We cannot, therefore, remain oblivious to
the fact that the sanctity of law has now been rudely called into question
and its authority greatly weakened. As Jews we must be deeply concerned
in assisting the European world back to a full consciousness of the majesty
and eminence of the rule of law.</p>

<p>But more than that, it was part of our earliest teaching that "thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." What clouds of hatred have not been
blown from one line of trenches to the other! What volumes of spleen
have not been sent from one country to the other! In countless speeches,
in newspapers and in books, the doctrines of dislike, of animosity, of deepest
malice have been preached. Men have been taught to look upon certain
neighbors as born enemies, to see in those who do not speak their own
tongue not only a stranger but an enemy. Back of the soldiers under arms,
back of the cannons with their deadly missiles, stand millions of loathing
men and women shooting darts of odium that reach further than any shell
and that are more poisonous than any gas. When shall we be able once
again to preach the beautiful teaching of the prophet, "Have we not all
one Father; hath not one God created us all?"</p>

<p>And lastly, we must bear in mind that the Jews have been opposed
from of old to the rule and reign of might as represented by the God of
War. In a syllabus on the history of the Peace Movement just published
by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, it is passing strange
to find that the Old Testament is entirely overlooked and that from the
first point, "The Cosmopolitan Ideal among the Greek Philosophers," the
jump is made at once to the second, "Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace."
And yet we know that in the outlook of our greatest teachers and philosophers
the vision of peace loomed large and powerful. "Ye shall not
teach war any more," said one of our greatest. And for another the true
sign of his prophetic mission is that he preached peace. How sadly these
teachings have been belied in the present war we know only too well.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Is War Necessary and Good?</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>N many circles it has been held that development is possible for the
human race only with the concomitance of war. What wonder&mdash;when
modern teachers have preached just such a necessity? Even so great a
religious leader as Luther said, "War is a business divine in itself, and is
as necessary as eating or drinking or any other work." Should we then
wonder that a historian such as von Treitschke has added, "War is the
last revealer of power. God will see to it that war always recurs as a
drastic medicine for the human race,"&mdash;or that another historian, Delbrueck,
should have said, "What beauty was to the Greek, holiness to the
Hebrew, government to the Romans; what liberty is to the Englishman, war
is to the Prussian." Nietzsche, one of the greatest of modern apostles,
has based many of his theories upon "a violent repudiation of any faith or
tradition which recognizes a power of right and justice lying beyond our
impulsive nature; an identification of self-restraint with degeneracy and
of self-assertion with health; a search for happiness in the conquest of
others rather than in self-conquest; a substitution of the Will to Power for
the Darwinian Will to Live, with the consequent intensification of the unconscious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and instinctive struggle for existence into a battle for conscious
mastery; and a sharpening of the competition of life, with its self-observed
rules of fair play or its traditionally imposed limitations, into a glorification
of war as the supreme test of strength, obtaining its justification in
success."</div>

<p>In a very remarkable article which appeared in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>
for last September, written by a man evidently most religiously minded,
appears the following: "Is the heart of England still strong to bear and
to resolve and to endure? How shall we know? By the test? What test?
That which God has given for the trial of people&mdash;the test of war. The real
court, the only court in which this case can and will be tried, is the court of
God. This twentieth century will see that trial, and whichever people shall
have in it the greater soul of righteousness will be the victor. The discovery
that Christianity is incompatible with the military spirit is made only among
decaying people. While the nation is still vigorous, while its population is
expanding, while the blood in its veins is strong, then on this hope no
scruples are felt. But when its energies begin to wither, when self-indulgence
takes the place of self-sacrifice, when its sons and daughters become
degenerate, then it is that a spurious and bastard humanitarianism masquerading
as religion declares war to be an anachronism and a barbaric sin."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Jewish Answer</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE Jewish attitude in regard to this great problem before the world
can be dealt with in a very few words. These words have already been
given to us in the twentieth chapter of Exodus: "If thou wilt make an altar,
thou shalt not wave thy sword over it; for if thou wavest thy sword over it
thou hast polluted it." It has been emphasized by the prophet Jeremiah
when he said, "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the
mighty man glory in his might. Let not the rich man glory in his riches; but
let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me,
that I am the Lord who exerciseth loving kindness, judgment and righteousness
on the earth." To this I will add only one single word of the Rabbis:
"The whole Torah exists solely for the sake of the ways of peace." This
ideal of peace has been the guiding star of Israel for which the Jew has
prayed morning, noon and night, and I trust that the young men of the
Menorah will be true to that which the Menorah typifies, and will assist in
the spreading of its light by upholding the reign of law, the reign of love,
and the reign of peace.</div>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> In the last number of <span class="smcap">The Menorah Journal</span>, Mr. Jacob H. Schiff ventured to suggest
the reverse influence, and to intimate that the association of England with Russia
was having an adverse effect upon the Jews in England. While Mr. Schiff does not tell
us upon what evidence he bases his views, I venture to guess that it consists largely of the
mistrust and ill-will caused in England by a small coterie of German-born bankers and
their following. But Mr. Schiff must know that this ill-will is in no way connected with
the fact that the men referred to are members of the Jewish race. Most of them have
never taken the least interest in Jewish affairs, some even have ostentatiously kept themselves
quite apart from any connection with them. And what is more, the feeling against
them is shared by Jews as well as by non-Jews in England.
</p><p>
Perhaps more serious still is Mr. Schiff's presentment concerning German anti-Semitism.
To speak simply of "a certain anti-Semitic tendency in Germany" is to coat the
truth with so much honey as almost to reverse its meaning. Anti-Semitism in Germany,
and especially in Prussia, has kept the Jews far from any positions of importance in
university life, on the bench, and in all state and military affairs. And to add that the
war "will crush out most of this anti-Semitic tendency" is to fly in the very face of well-ascertained
and authenticated facts of very recent occurrence. In <i>Harper's Weekly</i> for
February 6th of this year (p. 122), a series of such facts is adduced. Nor can Mr. Schiff
forget that forced conversion away from the Jewish faith and communion has nowhere
taken on the dangerous proportions it has in the Fatherland. Russia, it is true, has martyred
many Jewish bodies; German "Kultur" has quenched too many Jewish souls. History
will have to decide which has done the greater hurt to the Jewish cause.</p></div></div>

ways are peace. She is a tree of life to those that lay

<div class="sidenote" style="width: 144px;">
<img src="images/4damram.jpg" width="144" height="200" alt="DAVID WERNER AMRAM" title="DAVID WERNER AMRAM" />
<i><big>D</big>AVID WERNER AMRAM (born in Philadelphia,
1866), educated at the
University of Pennsylvania,
has been Lecturer and since
1912 Professor of Law in the
University of Pennsylvania
Law School. Professor Amram
has published books and
articles not only on common
law topics but on interesting
subjects in Jewish legal lore
and belles-lettres, among his
books being: "The Jewish Law
of Divorce," "Leading Cases in
the Bible," and "The Makers
of Hebrew Books in Italy."</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>O</big>NE of the methods by which the Jewish people
managed to survive endless misery
and persecution during eighteen centuries
of dispersion and protect themselves from the continuous
bombardment of their social and moral
citadels was by taking refuge in the study of the
law. The study and observance of the law, both
civil and religious, saved the Jews from degeneration
and vulgarization, and preserved for them the
humanizing memories of the thoughts and deeds of
their forebears. Through their common interest
in the law and its study they kept in touch with one
another throughout the lands of their dispersion,
they kept alive their feeling of brotherhood and the
memory of their ancient independence, and translated
this memory into a hope for the re-establishment
of the State, a hope which has never died.</div>


<div class='center'><br />"<i>The People of the Law</i>"</div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE term "the people of the law" has often been applied to the Jews
in the opprobrious sense that they are a people who deal according
to hard and strict rules, untouched by the qualities of love and mercy.</div>

<p>Properly understood, however, the term "the people of the law" is
a title of honor, one of which we may well be proud. As used in our
literature and by our people, "law" signifies something more than civil
and criminal jurisprudence. It is our word "Torah," meaning doctrine,
teaching, including not only what is generally known as law but also what
is known as ethics. The people of the law is the people that studies the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
great thoughts of its great men of all times, and adopts them as rules of
life which it becomes a duty and a pleasure to obey. The people of the law
is the people that in the midst of a world of chaos in which nation fought
nation with the weapons of death, sat in communion with a past world from
which came such messages as this: "Attend to me, O my people: and give
ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall go forth from me, and I will make
my judgment to rest for a light to the peoples.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hearken unto
me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear
ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye dismayed at their revilings. For
the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them
like wool: but my righteousness shall be forever and my salvation unto all
generations." Righteousness was the aspect of Deity that appealed to
the second Isaiah, and it was he that spoke words of comfort to our people
in all the days of their endless tribulations. The certain faith in the
ultimate success of right sustained them throughout the centuries and constitutes
their strength to-day. This is the law that was handed down to
them from of old, the law of right, which though often broken, often forgotten,
was always found again and cherished as the one thing worth while
in a world torn by the brutal instincts in man&mdash;instincts which the law had
chained and sought to make harmless.</p>

<p>So we may well cling to our title of the people of the law, remembering
that it does not mean merely Nomos, as the Hellenized Jews mistranslated
Torah, but legal and ethical doctrine and knowledge in its broadest sense,
and that it is the people of the law that have always shown their love of
knowledge and found it "a tree of life to those that lay fast hold on it."
Some ancient Jewish mystic said that the sword and the book came out of
heaven together and Israel had to choose. Israel did choose and thereafter
dreamed of days when swords would be beaten into ploughshares.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>How the Heritage of the Law Was Preserved</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE reading of the law has since time immemorial been an established
part of the synagogue service, thus educating the people to know
their law, the very phrases of which by constant reference and repetition
became part of their daily vocabulary. The origin of this custom of
reading the law in the synagogue may probably be found in the Biblical
references to the great convocations when King and scribe read the law
to the assembled people.</div>

<p>The effect of the dispersion of the Jews was to give a peculiar sacredness
to the law as the sole heritage of their earlier and happier days. In
most of the lands of their dispersion, the Jews dwelt a race apart, separated
from the rest of the community by mutual prejudices and antagonisms.
The soil on which they dwelt was so far as ultimate overlordship was concerned
the land of the stranger, but nevertheless in a very definite and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
special sense it was the Jews' own land. For it was a land in which the law
of the stranger was not the law. The law of the land of their dispersion
was not the law of the owner of the soil but the law of the Jews. In this
sense the Ghettos of Italy and the Gassen of Germany were not so much
Italian and German soil as they were Jewish. As by the modern fiction
of extraterritoriality the home of an Ambassador is considered part of his
own national territory, so these exclusively Jewish settlements were colonies
of Jud&aelig;a planted on foreign soil. They were separated from the
rest of the land by visible or invisible walls, and within these walls, hardly
touched by the influences that were at work shaping the life around them,
the ancient law of the Jews was preserved and handed down from generation
to generation. Hence during the Middle Ages the student of the law
became the most important member of the community, and all the energy
of the community that was not required to outwit the constant menace of
brutal force and religious persecution was devoted to the cultivation of
the law and of the literature that it gave rise to.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that since the beginning of the Talmudic
period, the civil law developed in certain directions only, because after all
the Jewish people had no land of their own in the usual sense and no central
authority and were constantly moving from place to place, always
subject to persecution. Some branches of their law were entirely neglected
and others abnormally developed.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Schools of the Law</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>N the Talmudic period, the judges, members of the Synhedrion, and
professors of the law schools, received a long professional training.
The course of study lasted seven years, at the end of which, having passed
their examination successfully, the graduates were eligible to assignment
as judges in the lower courts, from which they were promoted to act as
associate judges in the great Synhedrion and eventually might hope to
attain the dignity of full synhedrial membership. These judicial dignitaries
were obliged to be well versed in the languages, law and customs of
the contemporary peoples, especially in the laws of the Greeks and Romans.
Great academies of the law flourished in Palestine and still greater ones in
Babylonia, the latter eventually supplanting the former. These academies
called for the enthusiastic encomium of one Talmudist who said, "God
created these academies in order that the promise might be fulfilled that
the word of God should not depart from Israel's mouth."</div>

<p>The law students met twice a year in assembly for examination. Their
studies were pursued at home, except in the months of Elul and Adar when
they went up to the Assembly. Here they were arranged in classes and
under the direction of their masters heard lectures and discussed the subject
matter presented to them topically. At these Assemblies actual questions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of law were submitted from Jewish communities all over the Jewish
world, and the solutions to these problems were prepared and forwarded
by the great masters. In addition to these professional schools there were
everywhere general schools or, as we might say, high schools connected
with the synagogues. It is a tribute to the importance that was ascribed
to the high schools in later generations that their origin was projected
back to the days of the Flood when Shem and Eber established a law school
in which subsequently Isaac, Jacob, and Rebecca heard lectures. It will
be noted that according to this bit of folklore Rebecca was the first woman
law student. The same fancy which invented this most ancient of the
schools, also invented the law school which Judah built for Jacob in Egypt,
and the school established by Moses in which he and Aaron were the professors
and Joshua was the janitor.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Study of the Law "the Chief End of Man"</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE fancy of the people associated nearly all of its great men with the
study of the law. The entire tribe of Issachar was said to have
devoted itself to the study of the law, the merchant tribe of Zebulon furnishing
the means of support. God himself, according to another mystic,
was a professor in the celestial law school in which He taught the law to the
souls of all the righteous, in that heaven which they conceived of as a place
where the law might be perpetually studied; and even while the Temple was
still standing and sacrifices were being offered, the Jewish teachers used to
say that God does not require burnt offerings but the study of His law.</div>

<p>From all of these traditions it will be seen that to the ancients the
study of the law was the chief end of man. The Jew never considered
ignorance to be bliss and has little sympathy with the religious ideal of
many non-Jewish people that religion is more important than knowledge.
One of the great masters even went so far as to say that the ignorant man
cannot be pious. It was Simon the Just, one of the survivors of the Men
of the Great Synagogue, who said that the world stands upon three things,
the law, the service of God, and charity, and he put the law first, for the
first duty of a man is to observe the law. He must be just before he can be
charitable.</p>

<p>At one time it was sought to place some limitations upon the right
to become a student of law, and herein the schools of Hillel and Shammai
differed. Hillel was the democrat who held that all persons, without
exception, should enjoy the privilege of studying law; Shammai was
the intellectual aristocrat who sought to limit this privilege to those who
were wise, modest, of ample means and of goodly parentage, thereby establishing
rules similar to those that obtain in the best modern law schools,
which require a collegiate education as a preliminary to admission; but
Shammai went further in that he required the students to be wise and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
modest as well as persons of good breeding and of ample fortune. Just
how many of our modern law students could meet these requirements is a
question upon which I have no statistics. On this very matter of the
proper qualifications for admission to the privilege of studying law, we
have heard much in our time. Perhaps a contribution to the subject from
the old and somewhat neglected Code of the Mishnah would not be inappropriate.
The Mishnah says:</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>"Eight and Forty Qualifications for the Law"</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>"T</big>HE law is greater than priesthood and royalty, for royalty is acquired
by thirty qualifications, priesthood by four and twenty,
but the law by eight and forty, and they are as follows: Study, attention,
utterance, understanding, reverence, veneration, modesty, cheerfulness and
purity, service of the wise, choice of associates, debate with fellow students,
deliberation in study of Bible and Mishnah, a minimum of business, a minimum
of worldly pursuits, a minimum of pleasure, a minimum of sleep,
a minimum of talk, a minimum of jesting, forbearance, kindliness, faith in
the wise, resignation in suffering, knowing one's place, satisfaction with
one's lot, bridling one's words, refraining from self-complacency, amiability,
loving the Creator, loving His creatures, loving righteousness, loving
equity, loving reproof, eschewing worldly honor, not being puffed up by
learning nor delighting in laying down the law, helping one's neighbor bear
the yoke, inclining toward a favorable judgment of others, steadfast in the
truth, steadfast for peace, concentration in study, asking, answering, listening,
enlarging, learning with a view to teach, learning with a view to act, enabling
one's teacher to become wiser, thoroughly understanding what one
hears, and repeating every dictum in the name of him who uttered it."
I recommend this list of qualifications to the consideration of modern
teachers and students as well as to those who are concerned with the preparation
of a code of legal ethics for the profession.</div>

<p>The Jews loved the law and respected it and they honored its expounders
and administrators. They do not believe that the world can be made
over or made better by any man or by any preaching. They are by instinct
conservative, holding on with tenacity to the ideas and institutions
that have grown up in past times and that are expressions of the needs of
society and of its adjustment to the forces that play upon it. This is why
the law, which is the embodiment of these conservative forces, meets with
their respect and allegiance, why its study was cultivated with such zeal
in the past, and why in our own day it still finds so large a percentage of
votaries among the sons of our people.</p>

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big> STUDY of great Jewish names in modern literature
has impressed me with the fact that
every Jewish man of letters has attained
his fame by virtue of qualities that are essentially
Jewish. In other words, we cannot fully understand
the work of even modern Jewish literary men unless
we know the fundamental qualities of Jewish genius.
To illustrate what is meant by this assertion,
we may consider briefly the work of three
nineteenth century Jewish authors&mdash;Heine, Beaconsfield,
and Zangwill. These men are apparently
wholly different; and yet they attained literary eminence
through qualities or mind and heart which
we have learned to associate with the race from
which they sprang.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Heinrich Heine: A Jew at Heart</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>H</big>EINRICH Heine is the one writer of the
first rank that Germany can boast between
the death of Goethe in 1832 and the advent of
the younger generation of dramatists, Sudermann,
Hauptmann, and the rest, sixty years later. To
free himself from such a limitation as his Jewish
birth seemed to him to be, and with the more specific object, it is said, of
securing a government position in Prussia, Heine allowed himself to become
a convert to Christianity. "Judaism," he said, "is not a religion; it is a
misfortune." His conversion, however, failed to profit him. He lost the
fellowship of his own people, and was contemptuously called "the Jew"
by his enemies. In a sense, the designation was entirely just. A Jew at
heart Heine remained to the day of his death. On his death bed, speaking
of the Jews he said: "Queer people this! Downtrodden for thousands of
years, weeping always, suffering always, abandoned always by its God, yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
clinging to him tenaciously, loyally, as no other under the sun. Oh, if
martyrdom, patience, and faith in spite of trial can confer a patent of
nobility, then this people is noble beyond any other. It would have been
absurd and petty if, as people accuse me, I had been ashamed of being a
Jew."</div>

<p>Not only was Heine a Jew in his instinctive racial sympathies, but
his work bears the indelible impress of Judaism. It is a distinctively Jewish
product. In it appear the buoyancy of spirit which sustained him
under suffering that would have crushed a less resilient temper; the intellectual
arrogance; the proneness to censure rather than to commend; and
especially the excessive self-consciousness;&mdash;all these distinctively Jewish
traits were in him exaggerated and helped to make his work what it was.
It is his self-consciousness, in particular, that made his <i>Buch der Lieder</i> his
best production. In that remarkable collection of lyrics Heine appears at
his best, because the ability to compose songs that are the spontaneous
utterance of emotion, at one and the same time personal and representative,
is a Hebrew heritage. The Hebrew genius was essentially lyric, rather than
epic or dramatic; and in consequence, the lyrics of ancient Hebrew literature
are its chief glory. In proof of this, we have but to recall the dirges
and triumph songs, the reflective lyrics, and the liturgical hymns that compose
the collection we know as the Psalms. The excellence of both the old
Hebrew lyrics and of Heine's Lieder is to be found in the extraordinary
subjectivity of the Hebrew temper&mdash;the racial fondness for impassioned,
yet artistic, self-expression.</p>

<p>Yet Heine's Jewish traits are evident not only in the subjectivity of
his lyrics, but in the new and richer character that he gave to the German
Lied. This, hitherto vague and dreamy, became in his hands startlingly
concrete and definite. And this is true even when he expresses the most
subtle feelings. Always the most evanescent <i>Stimmung</i>, not less than
moods more primitively simple, find expression in metaphors so sensuously
material as to recall Solomon's Song. Compare a typical lyric of Heine,
such as the following:</p>

</table></div>


<div class='unindent'>Even so brief a comparison may illustrate, though it may not prove, that
for the ultimate source of Heine's Oriental exuberance and materialization,
so new to German literature, we must look in Jewish not in European
culture.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Spiritual Depth of Heine</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>P</big>ERHAPS because Heine was in spirit an Oriental, the Germans never
have known exactly what to make of him. Professor Francke says
(<i>History of German Literature</i>, p. 526) that Heine "produced hardly a
single poem which fathoms the depths of life." This assertion seems
scarcely defensible in view of such poems as the following:</div>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Wo wird einst des Wanderm&uuml;den">

</table></div>


<p>To find an equally beautiful expression of faith in God as a universal
spiritual presence that transcends all space relations, we must go back to
the anonymous Jewish poet who wrote the psalm in which occur the lines:</p>



<div class='center'>

<div class='unindent'>As a matter of fact, both poems are to be accounted for as equally the
product of a rarely gifted people&mdash;a people with a unique genius for
religion.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Disraeli and His Oriental Imagination</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>B</big>ENJAMIN DISRAELI belonged to a family who left Spain in the
fifteenth century to avoid the horrors of the Inquisition. Upon their
escape, in gratitude to the God of Jacob who had sustained them through
unheard of trials, they adopted the name Disraeli, in order that their race
might be forever recognized. Of such a family Benjamin Disraeli was a
worthy representative. He never was ashamed of his race. On the contrary,
he gloried in it, and lost no opportunity to put forth the claim of
his people to be the true aristocracy of the earth. "Has not the Jew the
oldest blood and the finest genius of the world?" he asks. And again, in
one of his books (<i>Tancred</i>, 1847), he says, "The Jews are of the purest
race; the chosen people; they are the aristocracy of nature."</div>

<p>It is Disraeli's Jewish characteristics that have bewildered and sometimes
offended his critics. He has been charged with insincerity because
he was so clever, and because he wrote with a kind of Oriental exuberance
that was to him entirely natural and a part of his Jewish heritage. Gilfillan
is the only critic, so far as I know, who has recognized that Disraeli's
excellences, and his defects as well, were racial rather than individual.
Speaking of his Oriental fancy and cleverness, Gilfillan says: "Disraeli
has a fine fancy, soaring up at intervals into high imagination, and making
him a genuine child of that nation from whom came forth the loftiest, richest,
and most impassioned songs the earth has ever witnessed&mdash;the nation of
Isaiah, Ezekiel, Solomon, and Job. He has little humor, but a vast deal
of diamond-pointed wit."<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Disraeli's Wit: A Purely Jewish Product</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>D</big>ISRAELI'S wit, which made him so many enemies, is a purely Jewish
product. It is satiric. Now satire was the form taken by Jewish
wit in the Middle Ages as a result of the hard conditions under which the
Jews lived. As one modern Jew has said, "The Jews seized the weapon of
wit, since they were interdicted the use of every other weapon." With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
every door closed in hostility against them, there was little they could do
but laugh with bitter irony at their fate, and with savage satire at their
oppressors. With such an ancestry as this behind him, it is not to be wondered
at that Disraeli's wit is scornful, and that he excelled in personal
satire and invective. It was never, however, unprovoked. Disraeli never
indulged in personal satire or invective except in his own defence. For
example, his mockingly ironical reply to the attack of a member of the
House of Commons named Roebuck, which was one of the most effective
rejoinders Disraeli ever made, was in answer to a most virulent arraignment
of his political motives. "I have always felt," he said, "that in this world
you must bear a great deal, and that even in this indulgent, though dignified,
assembly, where we endeavor so far as possible to carry on public
affairs without any unnecessary acerbity&mdash;still we must occasionally submit
to some things which the rules of this house do not permit. I could,
no doubt, have vindicated my character; but that would only have made
the honorable member from Bath speak once or twice more, and really
I have never any wish to hear him. I have had the most corrupt motives
imputed to me. But I know how true it is that a tree must produce its
fruit&mdash;that a crab-tree will bring forth crab apples, and that a man of
meagre and acid mind, who writes a pamphlet or makes a speech, must make
a meagre and acid pamphlet or a poor and sour speech. Let things, then,
take their course."</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Disraeli's Fondness for Allegory</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>NOTHER striking peculiarity of Disraeli was his fondness for veiled
allusion. Nearly all of his most popular novels&mdash;and this was <i>one</i>
of the main reasons for their phenomenal popularity&mdash;were thinly veiled
representations of Disraeli's own contemporaries, who were easily recognizable
by the reading public. Take, for instance, the admirable burlesque
entitled <i>Ixion in Heaven</i>, where the author tells how Ixion, king of Thessaly,
having fallen into disrepute on earth, was taken up into heaven by
Jupiter and feasted by the gods. Here Jupiter is really George the
Fourth and Apollo is the poet Byron. The latter's pose of gloomy misanthropy,
as well as his habit of fasting to keep from growing fat, are admirably
satirized in the following dialogue:</div>

<p>"You eat nothing, Apollo," said Ceres.</p>

<p>"Nor drink," said Neptune.</p>

<p>"To eat, to drink, what is it but to live; and what is life but death.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I refresh myself now only with soda-water and biscuits. Ganymede,
bring some."</p>

<p>Now this fondness for veiled allusion is distinctly a Hebrew characteristic.
The Arabs today have a saying, "as fond of a veiled allusion as
a Hebrew." This has always been a Hebrew trait. I suppose no literature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of any people consists so largely of allegory, in proportion to its bulk, as
does the Hebrew. In proof of this assertion, one needs but to allude to the
vogue in post-exilic Judaism of the Apocalypse, in which contemporary history
was presented in the form of allegory, and to the Rabbinical fondness
for the allegorical interpretation of the Scriptures. So it would not be difficult
to show that not only these qualities I have mentioned, but all the
qualities that made Disraeli admired or feared were his by virtue of his
Jewish inheritance.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Zangwill's Prophetic Spirit in "The War God"</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>SRAEL ZANGWILL knows the Jews, not as George Eliot did, through
a process of philosophic induction, but at first hand, because he is a
Jew by birth and breeding. He, unlike Heine, has never tried to conceal
the fact that he is a Jew. In Israel Zangwill all the tenderness and sympathy,
all the tenacity, the suppleness and adaptability, and it may be added,
the baffling inconsistencies of his race appear.</div>

<p>Inconsistent he certainly is. He has been an ardent Zionist, and in his
story "Transitional" (from <i>They That Walk in Darkness</i>) he seems to
hold that assimilation will never solve the Jewish problem; yet in <i>The Melting
Pot</i> he obviously regards assimilation as the inevitable and desirable
end of Judaism.</p>

<p>In spite of his inconsistencies, Zangwill is one in whom the ancient
ideals of Israel live again. It is in the spirit of the prophets that he wrote
<i>The War God</i> (1912). This play, with all its faults as an acting drama,
is nevertheless a remarkable document, voicing, as it does, on the very eve
of the breaking down of European civilization, the old prophetic protest
against the brutality and waste of war.</p>

<p>This protest dates back to at least the ninth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> It may
not be generally known that it was a Hebrew prophet who first advocated
the humane treatment of prisoners of war. The story is told in the Second
Book of Kings that when a band of marauding Syrians were corralled
in Samaria, the "king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them,
'My father, shall I smite them? Shall I smite them?' And he answered,
'Thou shalt not smite them: wouldst thou smite those whom thou has taken
captive with thy sword and with thy bow? Set bread and water before
them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.' And he prepared
great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he
sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came
no more into the land of Israel" (2 Kings 6:1-23). Again, Amos, in the
eighth century, in his arraignment of the sins of the nations, pronounces
God's severest judgments upon Damascus, Edom, Ammon, and Moab for
their cruelty in war. The charge against Edom, for example, is that "he
did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath forever." And the later
prophets' visions of the Messianic age include as the brightest feature of
that wished-for time the prediction that then "the nations shall not learn
war any more."</p>

<p>Of such a spirit Mr. Zangwill's play <i>The War God</i> is an expression.
It is a satire upon militarism, but a satire without exaggeration. The arguments
employed to justify the maintenance of a huge army and navy are
not a whit more absurd than the fallacies which have been put forth for a
generation by those who would justify the maintenance of armaments.
These so-called arguments are presented by "the Chancellor" who represents
Bismarck, and by the king of Gothia, in whom we may easily recognize
the Russian Czar. "Dominance," roars the Chancellor,&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'><br /><i>A Voice for Social Justice</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>Q</big>UITE outside the dramatic action of the play stands the Jew, Blum,
the Chancellor's secretary. Through his astuteness in managing the
Chancellor, he has hitherto moulded public policy according to his own will.
Finally, near the end of the play, he denounces Christian civilization in a
passage worthy of quotation:</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Man wins the realm of air and might have been">

</table></div>


<p>So might have spoken one of the ancient prophets of his race. Indeed
Amos, amid the orgies of the autumn festival at Bethel, did speak in the
same spirit when he denounced the formal service of worshippers who
ignored the claims of social justice. "Seek good and not evil," cries Amos,
"that ye may live; and so the Lord, the God of hosts, shall be with you,
as ye say. Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment
(justice) in the gate. It may be that the Lord God of hosts will be gracious
unto the remnant of Joseph."</p>

<p>So it is evident that even the literary work of modern Jews can be
understood and appreciated only as an expression of the characteristics of
the Jewish race. In this modern Jewish literature appears the exuberance,
the emotional intensity, and the love of social justice that were characteristic
also of ancient Hebrew literature as written by prophet, priest, and
sage.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Role of Israel in Human Emancipation</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>F</big>AR greater, however, than the work of these three authors, far greater,
indeed, than Israel's literature as a whole, of which they are a part,
is the life of this people, of which their literature is the record. We speak
of a nation's literature as great if it possesses three or four tragedies that
are classics. <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Othello</i>, <i>Macbeth</i> and <i>King Lear</i> would, for example,
be sufficient to justify the title "great" as applied to English literature.
What shall we say, then, as some one has suggested, of this people who for
more than twenty centuries have lived a tragedy more pathetic than any
the world's literature can show? Job has always seemed to me a type of
the Jewish race. We recall that majestic picture in the thirty-first chapter,
where Job stands up on his ash-mound, robbed of his wealth, bereaved
of his children, deserted by his wife, suffering the agonies of a loathsome
and incurable disease, and cast off, as it seems to him, by the very God in
whom he trusted, and yet, in the face of poverty, and bereavement, and
mortal pain, and bewildered isolation, asserts his own unchanged and unalterable
belief that righteousness is salvation.</div>

<p>Similarly Israel, through the long centuries of its tragic history, has
stood on the ash-mound of its national humiliation. Plundered, vilified,
and persecuted, a nation of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, from whom
men have hid their faces in aversion not concealed, Israel has yet clung with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a grip that nothing could weaken nor dislodge to the fundamental idea that
religion&mdash;the right relation of man to God&mdash;was not creed nor ritual, but
simply doing justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God.</p>

<p>We have been looking backward at the literary accomplishment of
three Jewish men of genius. It is, I believe, a fault of modern Judaism to
look backward instead of forward, as if the glory of Israel had indeed departed,
and as if nothing were left but to look back with pride and regret
upon what has passed like a dream away. But I believe Jews may look forward
now with confident hope toward the years that are to be. That Israel
has completely played its role&mdash;that it has finished its service to the world&mdash;cannot
for a moment entertain. Surely no one who believes in a philosophy
of history, who sees in human history more than a meaningless and
unrelated succession of events, can think that Israel has been preserved
through centuries of discipline for no end whatever. On the contrary, we
must believe that Israel has still a mission. What that mission is to be we
cannot now foretell. We of this generation are looking upon the breaking
down of European civilization. Some of us hope and expect that when the
smoke of battle has cleared away there will gradually be built up a new and
better social order. In this constructive work of rebuilding, who is better
fitted to take a prominent part than the Jew, with his noble heritage of
ideals, his passion for social justice? Jews may well rejoice as they
reflect upon what individual members of their race have through literature
contributed to the emancipation of the human spirit. And they may rejoice
also in the hope of what Israel may yet accomplish in the years that
are to be.</p>

<h2>Jochanan ben Zakkai</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Abraham M. Simon</span></h3>
<div class="sidenote" style="width: 147px;">
<img src="images/6asimon.jpg" width="147" height="200" alt="ABRAHAM M. SIMON" title="ABRAHAM M. SIMON" />
<i><big>A</big>BRAHAM M. SIMON
(born in Kalvaria, Russian-Poland,
in 1886; came to
America in 1904) received his
A.B. with honors from Harvard
College in 1910, and his
M.A. from the University of
Pennsylvania in 1911. During
1910-11 he was a Fellow in the
Dropsie College for Hebrew
and Cognate Learning of Philadelphia,
and he spent the summer
of 1911 at the Bodleian
Library at Oxford and the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale in Paris,
reading and copying Arabic
manuscripts. In 1913 he won
his Ph.D. in Semitics at the
University of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Simon was one of the original
members of the Harvard
Menorah Society, and read a
Hebrew poem</i> Ner Yisrael
(<i>"The Light of Israel"</i>) <i>at the
dedicatory exercises of the
Society.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE Jewish commonwealth was dissolved; the
Jewish nation disrupted. Jerusalem was
taken; the Temple had become a ruin.
The last vestige of independence seemed to have been
wiped out. All who had taken up arms were either
dead, or enslaved, or banished. The infuriated Roman
conquerors had spared neither the women nor
the children. It seemed as if Judaism had breathed
her last in that terrible year 70. Sadduceeism
was annihilated; the Zealots were exterminated; the
austere sentiment of the Pharisees, continually looking
back to ancient customs and institutions, tried
to assert itself. It is no longer permitted, they announced,
to eat meat or drink wine, now that the
Temple has fallen, because animals can no longer be
sacrificed on the holy altars, nor wine offered there
as a drink-offering. By such asceticism, these Pharisees
of the strict school would have caused the destruction
of Judaism. But there was a Hillelite still
alive&mdash;a man who had inherited the spirit of Hillel,
who rated conviction higher than ceremony, and
consulted the times more than the ancient forms. It
was he who kept the remnants together in close
union, and did not permit the spirit to vanish, although
the material bond was broken. This Hillelite
was Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Disciple and Favorite of Hillel</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>O</big>F the eighty disciples moulded by the great
Hillel to continue his policy, Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai was especially
distinguished. Before his death, Hillel is said to have designated
Jochanan as "the father of wisdom," and "the father of the coming generation."
Tradition divides Jochanan's life, like Hillel's, into three periods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of forty years each. The first forty years were spent in mercantile
pursuits; in the second he studied; and in the third he taught and managed
the affairs of the Jewish spiritual community.</div>

<p>Even before the destruction of Jerusalem, Jochanan's fame had
spread far and wide. He was a member of the Synhedrion and taught
the holy law within the shadow of the Temple. His school was called the
"Great House," and was the scene of many incidents which formed the subjects
for anecdote and legend. He was the first man who successfully combatted
the Sadducees, and who knew how to refute their arguments, which
were partly religious and partly juridical. But Jochanan's great fame was
chiefly due to the influence which he afterwards exercised at Jabneh.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Jochanan's Escape from Jerusalem</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>O</big>WING to his peaceful character, Rabbi Jochanan had joined the
party of peace when the Romans laid siege to Jerusalem, and on
several occasions urged the nation, and in particular his nephew, ben Betiach,
the leader of the Zealots, to surrender the city. "Why do you desire
to destroy the city, and give up the Temple to the flames?" said he
to the leaders of the revolution. But his well meant admonitions were disregarded
by the "war party." When he saw the end approaching, and
recognized that all was lost, he determined to leave the doomed city. He
counselled with his foremost disciples, Eliezer ben Hyrkanos, Joshua ben
Chananja and others. It was decided that Rabbi Jochanan should leave
the city, go to the Roman general, and plead for those people who had no
share in the rebellion. But to depart from the city was extremely dangerous,
as the Zealots kept up a constant watch and slew all who attempted
to leave. Rabbi Jochanan, therefore, caused a rumor to be spread of his
sudden sickness and later of his death. Having been placed in a coffin he
was carried to the city gates, at the hour of sunset, by his pupils Eliezer
and Joshua. When the funeral procession approached, it was stopped at
the gate within.</div>

<p>"Whose body do you carry here?" asked the Hebrew guard.</p>

<p>"We are carrying the crown of Israel, the body of our master, Rabbi
Jochanan ben Zakkai," they answered in tears.</p>

<p>The captain of the guards was affected.</p>

<p>"Open the gates, men, and let them pass," the captain ordered.</p>

<p>"Are you sure, captain, that Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai is dead?"
exclaimed one of the soldiers. "Maybe they are taking away a living
traitor. I will make sure that he is dead."</p>

<p>He raised his dagger to strike at the shrouded form of the Rabbi.</p>

<p>"Hold, soldier!" cried the captain; "to dishonor the body of the
saint would be a sin for which all Israel would have to atone. Open the
gates and let them pass in peace."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The fanatic reluctantly desisted; the gate was opened and the procession
passed through.</p>

<p>Vespasian received the fugitive in a friendly manner, the more since,
like Josephus, Jochanan prophesied imperial honors for the general.
Asked to name the favor he desired, Rabbi Jochanan, instead of seeking
personal gain, requested permission to establish a school at Jabneh (or,
as the place is sometimes called, Jamnia), where he could continue to give
his lectures to his disciples. The request was granted, and thereupon
Jochanan settled with his disciples in Jabneh, there to await the issue of
events.</p>

<p>What could Vespasian have thought of Rabbi Jochanan when he made
his request? Any one else bearing such prophecies might have asked for
gold, honor, great political preferments, while this Hebrew sage asked
simply for a corner where he could study undisturbed. How could the
Hebrew nation exist when the leaders, their great men, lacked ambition?
Little did Vespasian dream that his granting of the Rabbi's modest request
would undo the whole work of the Roman conquest.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Fall of the Temple: Jabneh Succeeds Jerusalem</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>N Jabneh, surrounded by his disciples, Rabbi Jochanan received the terrible
news of the fall of Jerusalem and the burning of the Temple.
Although he had foreseen the calamity, yet the news crushed the soul of the
great master. He and his disciples tore their garments and for seven days
wept and mourned in sackcloth and ashes. Jochanan, however, did not
despair, for he recognized the truth that Judaism was not indissolubly
bound with its Temple and its altar. He saw a new spiritual Temple emerge
from the ruins and smoke of the old one; he beheld Judaism rising to a
higher plane, offering faith, love, truth and happiness to all humanity.
He comforted his colleagues and disciples by reminding them that Judaism
still existed. "My children," he said, "weep not, and dry your tears;
the Romans have destroyed the material Temple, but the true altar of
God, the true place of forgiveness, they could not destroy, and it is with
us yet. Would you know where? Behold, in the homes of the poor, there
is the altar; love, charity, mercy, and justice are the offerings, the sweet
incense which pleases the Lord more than any sacrifice, as it is written:
For I take pleasure in mercy and not in burnt offerings." The next step
taken by Rabbi Jochanan and his friends was to convoke a Synhedrion at
Jabneh, of which he was at once chosen president. With no opposition,
Jabneh took the place of Jerusalem, and became the religious national center
for the dispersed community. It enjoyed the same religious privileges
as Jerusalem. All the important functions of the Synhedrion, by which it
exercised a judicial and uniting power over the distant congregations, proceeded
from Jabneh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></div>

<p>Rabbi Jochanan's motto was: "If thou hast learnt much Torah,
ascribe not any merit to thyself, for thereunto wast thou created."
He found his real calling in the study of the Law. His knowledge was
spoken of reverently as though it included the whole cycle of Jewish learning.
And not only the Law but many languages of the Gentiles occupied
the active mind of Rabbi Jochanan. The following description of him is
handed down to us by tradition: "He had never been known to engage
in any profane conversation. He had always been the first to enter the
Academy. He never allowed himself, wittingly or unwittingly, to be overtaken
by sleep while in the Academy. He had never gone a distance of four
cubits without meditating on the Torah and without phylacteries. No one
ever found him engaged in anything but study. He always lectured in
person to his pupils. He never taught anything which he did not hear from
his masters. He had never been heard to say that it was time to leave the
Academy." He advised a certain family in Jerusalem, the members of
which died young, to occupy itself with the study of the Torah, so as to
mitigate the curse of dying in the prime of life.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Rabbi Jochanan as Teacher and Commentator</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>R</big>ABBI Jochanan ben Zakkai may be designated as the representative
of Halachic Judaism, founded by the great master Hillel, rather
than as an originator or independent thinker. Hillel, the most respected
of all the teachers of the Law, had given to Judaism a special garb
and form. He had drawn the Law from the midst of contending sects into
the quiet precincts of the Beth-Hamidrash, and labored to bring into harmony
those precepts which were apparently opposed to one another in the
Law. Rabbi Jochanan employed and developed Hillel's method. Like
Hillel, he was also liberal in his general views. Thus he seems to have frequently
engaged in discussions with heathens. And such was his general
affability and courtesy to all that no man was ever known to have anticipated
his salutations. The Haggadic tradition connects numerous and
various sayings with the name of Rabbi Jochanan. The Haggadah was a
peculiarly fascinating branch of study. Abounding in brilliant sallies,
displays of ingenuity, and wonderful stories, it gave special scope for the
cleverness and the rich imagination of the lecturers. By it a Halachah
might be illustrated, or a passage of Scripture commented upon in a novel
fashion. Without binding himself to any strict exegetical principles, the
Haggadist would bring almost anything out of the text, and interweave his
comment with legends. At the same time, the Haggadah remained only
the personal saying of the individual teacher, and its value depended upon
his learning and reputation, or upon the names which he could quote in
support of his statements.</div>

<p>In this manner Rabbi Jochanan explained many laws and rendered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
them comprehensible, when they seemed obscure or extraordinary. Rabbi
Jochanan's view of piety corresponded with his teaching that Job's piety
was not based on the love of God, but on the fear of God. To love God;
to serve Him out of love and not out of fear; to study the law continually,
and to have a good heart&mdash;these were the essentials of a pious man. He
once saw the daughter of Nakdimon ben Gurion picking up a scanty nourishment
of barley-corn from among the hoofs of the horses of the enemy.
When he recognized the woman, he broke out in tears and told his companion
how he had signed her marriage contract as a witness when her
father gave her one million golden dinars, besides the wealth she received
from her father-in-law. Then the old sage exclaimed: "Unhappy nation,
you would not serve God, therefore you must serve your enemies; you
would not offer half a shekel for the Temple, therefore you must pay thirty
times as much to the institutions of your conquerors; you refused to keep
the woods and paths in order for the pilgrims, therefore you must build
roads and bridges for the Roman soldiers; and in you is fulfilled the
prophecy: Because thou servest not the Lord with joyfulness, and with
gladness of heart, by reason of abundance of all things, therefore shalt thou
serve thy enemies, which the Lord shall send against thee, in hunger and in
thirst and in nakedness and in want of all things."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Jochanan's Spirit in Affliction and in Death</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>R</big>ABBI Jochanan had domestic as well as national troubles. A dearly
beloved son was taken from him by death, and the soul of the
father was filled with grief. His five famous scholars came to offer sympathy
and consolation. One recalled the sorrow that Adam had endured
when he looked at the body of his murdered son. Another one urged the
example of Job; a third, that of Aaron, the brother of Moses; a fourth,
that of David, King of Israel.</div>

<p>"My sons," said the stricken father, "how can the sufferings of others
alleviate my sorrow?" But Eliezer ben Aroch, the most famous of his
scholars, then spoke to him and said:</p>

<p>"A certain man had a priceless jewel entrusted to him. He watched
it by day and by night for its safe keeping, but was always troubled by the
thought that he might lose it. When, therefore, the owner of the jewel
came to take it back, the man was happy, because he no longer had to fear
for the safety of the precious jewel. Even so, dear master, thou shouldst
rejoice when thou hast given thy son to God, who trusted thee with him,
since thou hast returned him in his innocence as thou didst first receive
him."</p>

<p>"My son," said the master, "thou hast truly comforted me."</p>

<p>When Rabbi Jochanan was nigh to death, his colleagues and disciples
gathered round him in sorrow and trembling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Master, Light of Israel!" they exclaimed. "Why weepest thou?"</p>

<p>And the master answered: "If they were about to lead me before a
king of flesh and blood, who today is and tomorrow is in the grave&mdash;if he
were wroth with me, his wrath were not eternal; if he should put me in
chains, his chains were not eternal; if he should put me to death, that death
would not be eternal; I might appease him with words or bribe him with
gifts. But now they are about to lead me before the King of kings, the
Holy One, blessed be He, who lives and remains through all eternity. If
He is wroth with me, His wrath is eternal; if He casts me into chains, His
chains are eternal; if He puts me to death, it is eternal death; Him no
words can appease, no gifts soften. And further, there are two ways&mdash;one
to hell, one to Paradise; and I know not which way they will lead me. Is
there not cause for tears?"</p>

<p>Asked to give his disciples a last blessing, he told them:</p>

<p>"Fear God even as ye fear men."</p>

<p>His disciples seemed disappointed, whereupon he added:</p>

<p>"He who would commit a sin first looks around to discover whether
any man sees him; so take ye heed that God's all seeing eye see not the sinful
thought in your heart."</p>

<p>His death occurred only a few years after the destruction of the Temple.
But in that short time he saved Judaism, and the impress he left upon
Israel is evident from the famous dictum of the Talmud: "With the death
of Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai the light of wisdom was quenched." And
many still believe that none like him&mdash;scholar and diplomat&mdash;has since
arisen in Israel.</p>

<h2>Zionism: A Menorah Prize Essay</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Marvin M. Lowenthal</span></h3>

<div class='center'>(<i>Concluded</i>)</div>


<div class="sidenote"><i>This Essay was awarded the
Menorah Prize at the University
of Wisconsin last year. In the
first part, printed in our April issue,
the author reviews the status of the
Jews in medieval Europe and describes
the effects upon the Jews of
the razing of the Ghetto walls and the
play of the modern forces of Emancipation,
Enlightenment, Nationalism,
and Anti-Semitism. In the
situation resulting, the author distinguishes
between the "Jewish problem"
("an immediate concrete maladjustment
where life and property
are imperiled"), existing chiefly in
Eastern Europe, and the "Jewish
position" ("a social, cultural, or
spiritual disharmony or repression"),
prevailing in Western Europe
and America. After rejecting Reform
Judaism and the "palliative
measures" of philanthropy as answers
to the situation, the author proceeds
in this concluding instalment to
a consideration of the third alternative,
namely, "re-establishment of a
national center where, perhaps not
the entire people, but a remnant can
be saved."</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HAT the effort to ameliorate the conditions
through charity, and the effort to
assimilate and yet keep the essentials
apart, are ineffectual has been shown. There remains
the third possibility&mdash;Zionism. To a
consideration of its theoretic background this
section will be devoted. Although a natural commingling
is unavoidable, Zionism presents three
distinguishable aspects&mdash;as (1) a creative vision,
(2) a solution, (3) a fulfillment.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The National Ideal</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>N its first aspect, Zionism applies the sauce of
the proverbial goose to the proverbial gander.
Nationalism is the partial cause, or at least
the excuse, for making the modern position of the
Jew in Europe untenable; nationalism for the
Jew becomes a means of evacuating the position.
Europe has intimated to the Jew that it can get
along without him; the Jew now proposes to
show that he can get along without Europe.
Nationalism is nothing new to the Jew; from the final dispersion in 70
C. E., through the universalism of the Roman Empire and later of the
Roman Church, the national ideal, as indicated in our introduction,
was religiously preserved; but its modern practical form first arose
among the leaders of the Chovevei Zion movement in the middle of
the last century. The "Rom und Jerusalem" of Moses Hess (1862),
"Die Verj&uuml;ngen des J&uuml;dischen Stammes" of Graetz, the Jewish historian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>(1864), the "Hashachar" of Smolenskin (1869), the "Auto-Emancipation"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">of Dr. Leo Pinsker (1882) clearly foreshadowed the final and effective</span><br />
expression of political Zionism&mdash;namely, "The Jewish State," published
by Herzl in 1896.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Vision of a Jewish State</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>B</big>ASING its structure on the formulas of the prophets,<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who proclaimed
that polity was indispensable for effecting the true mission of Israel&mdash;for
the realization of the religious, social, or ethical ideal; conceiving Israel,
as did Reform Judaism, to be its own Messiah, not fated, however, to
remain a minutely scattered leaven among nations who condemned or destroyed
it, but destined according to the prophetic promise to re-establish
itself upon Zion;<a name="FNanchor_2_7" id="FNanchor_2_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_7" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> convinced that a true assimilating of the fruits of
emancipation in contradistinction to an imitating of Gentile culture could
only be effected by an emancipation from within, by an auto-emancipation;<a name="FNanchor_3_8" id="FNanchor_3_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_8" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
the vision of a Jewish State grew into outline. To the consummation
of the picture, a wealth of economic, scientific, and cultural inspiration
has been devoted. Herzl and his predecessors selected the stone which
had been rejected by the philanthropists and the earnest, but mistaken,
builders of Reform Judaism in their efforts to create a fit habitation for
the European Jew; and lo! it has become the chief corner-stone.</div>

<p>To assure the foundation, to justify the conception of a Jewish State,
a number of powerful arguments other than above indicated have been
brought to bear. The problem of race was attacked,<a name="FNanchor_4_9" id="FNanchor_4_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_9" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and a consequent
demolition of the basis of Reform Judaism undertaken, whereby the racial
identity of the Jew became demonstrated and a comparative racial purity
established. In turn, the claim of the anti-Semites that the Jewish race
indeed existed, but to the peril of Western civilization, received scientific
annihilation. At the most, the Aryan race was proclaimed a myth and
Teutonic superiority a lie;<a name="FNanchor_5_10" id="FNanchor_5_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_10" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> at the least, a justification of the Jewish race
was achieved upon its contribution to civilization: in metaphysics, of the
vision of reality in flux; in morals, the conception of the value of the individual;
in religion, the conception of Jehovah as a moral-arbiter; in culture,
a literature of basic inspiration for the western world.<a name="FNanchor_6_11" id="FNanchor_6_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_11" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<div class='center'><br /><i>The Moral Right of the Jewish Race to Survival</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HAT this race, definable in identity and valuable in content, is being
either crushed by force or dissipated by freedom, raises on one
hand the next question for creative Zionism, and constitutes on the other
the problem which Zionism in its aspect as a "solution" assails. The
question: Has this race, facing destruction, a moral right to survival?
is in the instinctive, Darwinian sense unnecessary. Every race has a right
to survive if it can prove its right by surviving; however, like most evolutionary
thinking, this is tautological. Nevertheless, an affirmative answer<a name="FNanchor_7_12" id="FNanchor_7_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_12" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
has been advanced, based on the conception of values recognized since Aristotle;
whereby was demonstrated the intrinsic value of the Jews as witnessed
by their virility and capacity for an intelligent enjoyment of life,
which their social customs, religious ideals, and cultural ethos have created
for them, and which have won for them the title "<i>Am Olam</i>," the perpetual
people; and their instrumental value in the preservation and enrichment of
life for the Western world at large, as witnessed by their contributions to
civilization outlined above.</div>

<p>To the final question: How may the destruction facing a race, worth
the saving, be averted? the Zionists, as already shown, answer: Let us establish
a Jewish State. It now remains to explain how this answer can be
made effective.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Program of the First Zionist Congress</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>LTHOUGH Herzl, like Pinsker, at first was indifferent as to the location
of the State, Palestine was decided upon at the First Zionist
Congress for the following practical reasons:<a name="FNanchor_8_13" id="FNanchor_8_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_13" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></div>

<p>1. Palestine is, of inhabitable and sufficiently uninhabited lands, the
nearest to Russia and Roumania, where the greatest number of Jews are
undergoing physical suffering.</p>

<p>2. It is not ruled by Christians, and penal discriminatory laws against
Jews are not there in force.</p>

<p>3. Conditions of Oriental life are in accord with the stage and condition
of life reached by Jews in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>4. The country is already somewhat of a Jewish center.</p>

<p>5. Jews are more familiar with the language spoken there than with
any West European language.</p>

<p>6. Palestine for sentimental reasons has a power of attraction that
would operate practically upon Jews wishing to emigrate, and a power
of inspiration which would flower in equally practical works when once
Jews were established there.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p><p>Zionism, as a "solution," sets forth, in the program of this Congress,
four ways to achieve its object:<a name="FNanchor_9_14" id="FNanchor_9_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_14" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>1. To promote the settlement of Jewish agriculturalists, handicraftsmen,
industrialists, and professional men. This would offer an asylum
for the persecuted Jew and assure him of an independent livelihood, and
so simultaneously relieve suffering, starving Jewry&mdash;the immediate phase
of the <i>problem</i>&mdash;and afford a substantial basis for the prosperity and ensuing
civilization of the State.</p>

<p>2. To centralize the Jewish people by means of general institutions
agreeable to the laws of the land. By institutions are meant banking-houses,
schools, etc., which would promote the welfare of the people and
render the growth of a culture more unconstrained.</p>

<p>3. To strengthen Jewish national self-consciousness and national sentiment;&mdash;this
to be accomplished by the establishment of newspapers and
societies throughout the world, so as to secure the aid or interest of the
Jew who does not want to assimilate in behalf of a national center, and
offer a road of return to the Jew who has become assimilated at the cost of
his spiritual happiness.</p>

<p>4. To obtain the sanctions of Governments necessary for carrying
out the objects of Zionism. This demand for legal assurances, for a charter
if possible, distinguishes political Zionism in the matter of means from
the mere small-scale colonizing efforts of the philanthropists and the
Chovevei Zion societies, precisely as the very conception of a State distinguishes
it in the matter of ends. In the words of Herzl, "We do not
wish to smuggle in any settlers, and above all, we do not wish to bring about
any 'accomplished facts' without preliminary agreement. We have absolutely
no interest in bringing about an economic strengthening of Turkey
without a corresponding compensation. The whole thing is to be accomplished
according to the simplest usage in the world: 'do ut des.' We
Zionists think it more foolish than noble to settle colonists without any
legal and political guarantees."<a name="FNanchor_10_15" id="FNanchor_10_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_15" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Variant Views of Zionist Groups</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>B</big>ESIDE the political Zionists, a large group can be distinguished as
Opportunist Zionists, the chief representative of whom is Israel
Zangwill,<a name="FNanchor_11_16" id="FNanchor_11_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_16" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> who in his eagerness to relieve the Jewish <i>problem</i> has become
impatient with the slow and seemingly fruitless political progress, and who
desires to lead his people to any vacant, habitable territory rather than
wait for a charter in Zion. Other leaders in the movement, such as Ussischkin,
contend that until the charter is granted, colonization in Palestine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
should continue, both to satisfy the Jewish demand for emigration
and to give weight to the justice and necessity for autonomy.</div>

<p>In sum, the establishing of Zion, while in process, will rescue the sorely
oppressed, magnetize and concentrate the interests of Jewry at large, and
force the issue of suicide or salvation upon the race; and the establishment
of the State, once accomplished, will rejuvenate a people. "They
shall revive as the grain and blossom as the vine; the scent thereof shall
be as the wine of Lebanon." (Hosea 14.7). In the Zionist vision, assured
not by the prophecies, but by the achievements of a glorious past, this new
wine, ripening and enriching its flavor in a cup that had long been bitter,
will be partaken of by the nations, Jew and Gentile. Jewish culture in
its widest sense, embracing the realization of ethical, social, and artistic
ideals, nourished by a people living again a homogeneous, autonomous,
national life free as it has not been for eighteen centuries from outward
pressure&mdash;a life imperative for the production of culture&mdash;will go forth
as a pure vintage, taking its place with the vintages of other nations, to
satisfy the soul in dry places and make strong the bones; and over this
new wine a new Kiddush may perhaps be spoken. The Reform Jew, the
"assimilated" Jew, who finds himself to-day in what we have nominated
a <i>position</i>, in a conscious or unconscious inspiration and pride induced
by the resurrection of a motherland, as the German in America is inspired
by his national unity in Europe, will indeed find his soul satisfied in dry
places, and can more generously and effectively contribute to the welfare
of the fatherland of which he is a citizen. The Jew who walks in the darkness
of a Russia, where his situation is a <i>problem</i> and where existence itself
is threatened, will discover in this reawakened motherland a hope and
possibly a material aid which will make strong his bones that he may endure
until emancipation.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Communistic Aims of the Social Zionists</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>U</big>NDER the stimulus of a new creative vision, many poets, practical or
otherwise, have brought their own tints to add to the rosy prospect,
and these we have designated to be Zionism as a "fulfillment." Just prior
to the birth of these United States, Thomas Paine, who in a few respects
was the Herzl of the new republic, rapturously exclaimed in his pamphlet
<i>Commonsense</i>: "We have it in our power to begin the world over again. A
situation similar to the present hath not happened since the days of
Noah!" Stimulated by the potentialities of an empty country and a great
race eager to reoccupy it, modern theorists have likewise, and with some
reason, discovered in Palestine a land of promise.</div>

<p>Basing their faith in the inherent demand for social justice which
racial genius, as witnessed in the Deuteronomic experiment and the whole
social trend of the prophetic writings, has created as a permanent characteristic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of the Jew and which the injustice of centuries has accentuated,
a group of Jewish socialists have entered the Zionist cause in the hope of
establishing a form of the communistic principle as a foundation for the
new society. The communistic ownership of land is particularly urged.
Past experiments of this nature&mdash;the Brook Farm and the French Commune
as a small and a large example&mdash;have failed partly for lack of scientific
guidance and sufficient exact knowledge of actual conditions, and
partly because of the social unfitness of the participants. Social Zionism,
however, has secured for its director an acknowledged authority in communistic
economics, Dr. Franz Oppenheimer of the University of Berlin;
and it is counting on the Jewish heritage of social instinct to furnish the
proper human material for its purpose. Amos, the herdsman of Tekoa,
who came down from his mountain in 750 B. C. to storm at the capitalistic
greed of Israel, raised the first plea in history for social justice. The successful
consummation of the prophet's ideal in the new Israel would be a
contribution to the world distinctly Hebraic and possibly the most valuable
of the modern Jew.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Yearning for a Spiritual Revival</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>O Ahad Ha-'Am,<a name="FNanchor_12_17" id="FNanchor_12_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_17" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the leading writer of to-day in Hebrew, a "spiritual
revival" should be the desideratum of the Zionists. Spiritual is of
course not used in the restricted religious sense, but as the opposite of
material. Although Ahad Ha-'Am concedes the establishment of a center
in Palestine to be a necessity, he considers it only a means to the end of
an "awakening" of spiritual forces in art, morals, and national consciousness
among Jewry at large; and, to hasten this end, he urges the establishment
of a University, an art-school, and bands of workers in the spirit&mdash;poets,
painters, and all manner of creators&mdash;for he conceives the Jews not
to be a young race who must climb from satisfying the needs of the belly to
the needs of the brain, but an old people who can and must satisfy both
demands together.<a name="FNanchor_13_18" id="FNanchor_13_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_18" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></div>

<p>Finally, the great mass of European Jewry, who weep on the Ninth of
Ab, who send their pittance to the Jews of the Holy City in order that
they may devote their days to lamenting at the old Wall, who pray each
Passover "next year at Jerusalem," and who treasure their little casket
of Palestinian earth, which some day will be placed over their shroud, look
to Zionism as a "fulfillment" in its literal, Biblical meaning. Although
the yearning for such a fulfillment may never be satisfied, it constitutes
the impelling force, the prime motive, behind the people who are to settle
once again in Canaan, and who are the stuff of which the philosophers'
dreams are to be made.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p><p>The opportunists who work for the day when the plowman shall overtake
the reaper, the politicals who plan that the house of Jacob may possess
its possessions, the culturals who behold upon the mountain the feet
of him who bringeth glad tidings, the socialists who strive to draw righteousness
and peace within kissing distance, and the devout who pray that
out of Zion shall go forth the Law, are all intermingling composites of the
Zionist dream. That the dream is not in vain, there is no positive assurance;
but somewhere it is written that Palestine <i>is</i> the Land of Promise.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Organization of Zionism</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>S</big>OPHISTICATION makes for sluggishness of action; and a sophisticated,
practical people, such as the Jews, surrounded by an equally
sophisticated world, have not marched upon Jerusalem with the flag-flying
alacrity of the Crusaders. However, their sophistication has substituted
for speed a broad measure of surety; and a summary of the organization
of the movement and the work accomplished within and without Palestine
gives promise that, if the will behind Zionism be sustained, the Jews who
wail at the Wall may profitably direct their energies elsewhere.</div>

<p>The Zionist organization comprises all Jews who subscribe to the Zionist
program and pay the annual contribution, known as a shekel, varying
from 15 cents to 25 cents in different countries. The program is that
formulated at the First Zionist Congress (Basel, 1897): "to obtain for
the Jewish people a publicly recognized and legally assured home in Palestine."
The members are grouped in local societies which, in turn, are
organized into national federations, to be found at present in Argentina,
Belgium, Bukowina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia-Slavonia-Herzegovina,
Egypt, England, France, Galicia, Germany, Holland, Hungary, Italy,
Roumania, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United
States. Unfederated societies exist in Palestine, Morocco, Servia, Sweden,
Denmark, Greece, China, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand.<a name="FNanchor_14_19" id="FNanchor_14_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_19" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In
short, the atlas is practically exhausted. With a representation proportional
to the number of shekel-payers, a Congress convenes bi-annually in
a central European city (usually Basel), resolves, and prosecutes all work
incumbent upon the furtherance of Zionist purpose. The executive power,
although formerly invested in a president, is now exercised, since the death
of Herzl (1904) and the resignation of Wolffsohn, by a commission of
five, acting as the head of a committee of twenty-five, who constitute a
permanent body meeting at intervals between the sessions of Congress.<a name="FNanchor_15_20" id="FNanchor_15_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_20" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The Congress itself is divided into party-groups, based on policy, and
representative of the different theoretic elements that guide the movement.</p>

<p>The original Government party, which stood shoulder to Herzl in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
brilliant but unsuccessful diplomatic schemes to secure a charter from the
Sultan, upon the overthrow of the autocracy in Turkey (1908), has
abandoned purely political Zionism, for the expedient reason that the
Young Turk government has naturally been reticent in the granting of
broad concessions. Political Zionism, of which Max Nordau and David
Wolffsohn<a name="FNanchor_F_21" id="FNanchor_F_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_21" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> are the leading protagonists, has through the accidents of
Turkish politics been rendered ineffective; and the actual work of Zionism
rests now upon the policies of the Opportunist wing, although the creation
of a State, autonomous in as great a degree as possible, is the cardinal
aim of the Zionists, and must be, in order to distinguish the movement from
a large-scale philanthropy.<a name="FNanchor_16_22" id="FNanchor_16_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_22" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Parties in Zionism</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE Opportunists were divided into two groups&mdash;the followers of
Zangwill who urged immediate colonization anywhere, and the
Ziyyone Zionists (Zionists toward Zion) who favored immediate settlement
in Palestine. The first party broke from the Zionist movement at the
Seventh Congress, instituted the Jewish Territorial Organization (ITO),
and have vainly devoted their energies toward securing lands in North,
East, and West Africa, Mesapotamia, and Australia.<a name="FNanchor_17_23" id="FNanchor_17_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_23" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The Ziyyone
Zionists, however, possess the controlling vote, and in the last Congress
(1913) annulled the Basel program, temporarily at least, by securing from
the Congress a recognition of the work of settlement in Palestine as the
primary task.<a name="FNanchor_18_24" id="FNanchor_18_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_24" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></div>

<p>Socialistic Zionism is represented by the Po'ale Zion, a small but vigorous
group, who are endeavoring to secure at least the adoption of the
communistic ownership of land in the pursuance of the Opportunist program.</p>

<p>Dr. Franz Oppenheimer, lecturer in economics at the University of
Berlin, has recently issued a pamphlet disclosing the success of the Merchavia
Colony, a co-operative settlement near Nazareth, and demonstrating
that the only practical method of achieving large-scale colonization is by
this means.<a name="FNanchor_19_25" id="FNanchor_19_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_25" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Strong in numbers and in influence, the Mizrachi party represents the
orthodox wing of Jewry, who "believe a faithful adherence to the Torah
and Tradition in all matters pertaining to Jewish life constitute the duty
of the Jewish people."<a name="FNanchor_20_26" id="FNanchor_20_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_26" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In the assemblage of futurists, the Mizrachi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
stands as the spirit of the past, to whom all plans must be justified, and
whose power has its source in the religious fervor of the majority of eastern
Jews.</p>

<p>Finally, the Cultural Zionists may be said to find representation in all
parties, for the furtherance of spirituality is inseparably bound up in the
aims of every Zionist.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Financial Institutions of Zionism</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE financial instruments by which the practical Zionist aims are
seeking accomplishment are (1) the Jewish Colonial Trust,<a name="FNanchor_21_27" id="FNanchor_21_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_27" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
incorporated as a limited company in London (1899) with a capital stock
of $20,000,000 and a paid-up capital of $1,324,000; (2) the Anglo-Palestine
Company,<a name="FNanchor_22_28" id="FNanchor_22_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_28" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> an offshoot of the Colonial Trust, with a paid-up capital
of $500,000, which finances Zionist undertakings in Palestine, and
declares annual dividends of 4 1-6 per cent.; (3) the Anglo-Levantine
Banking Company,<a name="FNanchor_23_29" id="FNanchor_23_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_29" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the financial institution of the Zionists devoted to
their undertakings in the remainder of Turkey, with a capital of $125,000
declaring 6 per cent. returns; (4) the Jewish National Fund,<a name="FNanchor_24_30" id="FNanchor_24_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_30" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> whose
object is to acquire land in Palestine as the inalienable property of the
entire Jewish people, with a capital of $650,000 raised by individual contributions;
(5) the Palestine Land Development Company,<a name="FNanchor_25_31" id="FNanchor_25_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_31" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> with a registered
capital of $87,500, organized for the purpose of (a) acquiring,
improving, and dividing into small holdings large Palestinian estates, (b)
laying out and cultivating intensive crops, (c) systematically settling and
training agricultural laborers in Palestine.</div>

<p>Of late the Jewish Colonization Association, which is backed by the
forty-million dollar fund of Baron de Hirsch, is co-operating with the
Zionists in the purchase of Palestinian land to be administered by the Palestine
Land Development Company.<a name="FNanchor_26_32" id="FNanchor_26_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_32" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The actual achievements, which these instruments have been the means
of effecting, may be summarized in two classes&mdash;Palestinian and non-Palestinian.
In both fields, the several branches of Zionist aims have borne
fruit.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>What Zionism Has Accomplished in Palestine</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>P</big>ALESTINE in 1880 contained 30,000 Jews, who studied the Law,
wailed at the Wall, and lived miserably on the alms (the Chalukah)
of pious Jewry at large. In 1911 the Jews comprised 100,000 out of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
total population of 700,000. In Jerusalem are 50,000 Jews, 7,000 at
Tiberias, 8,000 at Safed, and 10,000 at Jaffa. A large proportion, it is
true, are settlers of the Ghetto type, but the young generation is rapidly
being changed by the growing school-system.<a name="FNanchor_27_33" id="FNanchor_27_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_33" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></div>

<p>Numbering about fifty, Jewish agricultural colonies extend the length
of the Holy Land and support some 5,000 Jews in their yield of olives,
dates, wine, sugar, cotton, grain, and cattle. Broad streets, clean homes
with gardens, and orchard land characterize the standard of living in the
colonies, as machinery and agricultural school students characterize their
modern standard of gaining their livelihood.<a name="FNanchor_28_34" id="FNanchor_28_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_34" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> A constantly increasing
number of emigrants are streaming into the Holy Land, although the
Zionists are devoting their main endeavors toward firmly establishing the
resident inhabitants and bettering their condition. On April 3, 1914, the
London <i>Jewish Chronicle</i> reported the emigration from the single port of
Odessa as numbering 250 persons a week.<a name="FNanchor_29_35" id="FNanchor_29_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_35" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In 1886, $1,800,000 of trade passed out through Jaffa, the port of
Palestine; in 1909, the value of the exports rose to $7,500,000.<a name="FNanchor_30_36" id="FNanchor_30_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_36" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Rischon-le-Zion,
the oldest colony and containing 500 inhabitants, annually produces,
alone, more than a million gallons of wine.<a name="FNanchor_31_37" id="FNanchor_31_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_37" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The schools of the older class&mdash;Talmud Torah and Yeshibah&mdash;still
dominate; but, following the example of the Alliance Israelite, a modern
type of school with a modern curriculum taught in Hebrew has been established
in every colony, and culminates in a Gymnasium at Jaffa as the
principal national educational institution. The attendance of the colonial
schools number about 1,500, and in the Talmudic schools number several
thousands. The Mikveh Israel Agricultural School, near Jaffa, is the
center of vocational instruction in Palestine, and aids materially the work
of the colonists. Funds for a Hygienic and Technical Institute have likewise
been started to further practical education.<a name="FNanchor_32_38" id="FNanchor_32_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_38" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Revival of Jewish Culture</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE cultural revival in Palestine is plainly apparent in the excellent
work of the Bezalel,<a name="FNanchor_33_39" id="FNanchor_33_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_39" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> the school of arts and crafts in Jerusalem,
named after the builder of the first tabernacle in the wilderness, where are
devised carpentry, copperware, wood-carving, basketry, painting, and
sculpture "of cunning workmanship" and of distinctly Hebraic design.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Another sign of great hope springs from the widespread revival of ancient
Hebrew as a living tongue, which has become an awkward necessity among
the older Jews gathered from many different nations, and the free and
natural expression of the children. Several weeklies and monthlies are
published in Hebrew.<a name="FNanchor_34_40" id="FNanchor_34_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_40" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> A National Jewish Library, soon to be housed in
a fireproof building at Jerusalem, was founded by Dr. Joseph Chazanowicz,
a Zionist leader in Russia, who devoted his entire income to it. In
1910 the Library contained something over 15,000 volumes.<a name="FNanchor_35_41" id="FNanchor_35_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_41" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Finally,
the Eleventh Congress (1913), convened on the 2,500th anniversary of the
destruction of the old temple on Mount Moriah, witnessed the pledging of
$100,000 to the building of a Jewish National University at Jerusalem&mdash;a
new temple of culture and science.<a name="FNanchor_36_42" id="FNanchor_36_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_42" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></div>

<p>Precisely as the roots are more important than the blossoms in the
growth of a plant, the accomplishments without Palestine are more significant
than within. To-day the Golus (Diaspora) is the root, and Palestine
the stalk; some day the Zionists hope to reverse the simile&mdash;this, in
short, is the essence of the entire movement.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Accomplishments of Zionism Beyond Palestine</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>Z</big>IONISM'S chief aims without Palestine are two: (1) Revival of national
consciousness, (2) Relief of the persecuted. In regard to
the second, the Zionist organization, constantly working to shift emigration
from West to East, has in a measure focused it upon Palestine; and more
important, it is rapidly perfecting adequate machinery, which once securing
the motive power of money in such quantities as is now devoted to
the Jewish Colonization Association, will appreciably lessen the gravity of
the Jewish <i>problem</i>.</div>

<p>In regard to the awakening of the national consciousness, the Zionist
societies, which number in the thousands, constitute centers for the dissemination
of propaganda and the stimulation of study in all things Jewish;
and the Zionist press, comprising one hundred newspapers and periodicals,
the official of which is <i>Die Welt</i>, and the leading American representative,
<i>The Maccabaean</i>, materially aid this preaching of Zion gospel.
Under the stimulus of the movement, numerous student societies have
sprung up abroad, promoting and crystallizing a national sentiment and
a race interest, while older societies of this order, such as the Kadimah,
have received a renewed impetus. Women's societies of a literary, educational,
and social character&mdash;the Benoth Zion (Sofia and New York)
and the Hadassah (Vienna and New York) for example&mdash;have taken a
place in the general revival.<a name="FNanchor_37_43" id="FNanchor_37_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_43" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p><p>The effect of Zionism in large centers of population is ably shown by
Charles S. Bernheimer in his study of the Russian Jew in the United States,
and his findings may be taken as typical. In general, the Zionist societies
have formed the chief social centers of the ghetto,<a name="FNanchor_38_44" id="FNanchor_38_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_44" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> have opened religious
schools<a name="FNanchor_39_45" id="FNanchor_39_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_45" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and libraries,<a name="FNanchor_40_46" id="FNanchor_40_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_46" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> have brought the radicals in religion under the
influence of the national idea,<a name="FNanchor_41_47" id="FNanchor_41_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_47" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and so prevented the loss of religion from
being followed by a loss of race-consciousness, and have "enlisted the sympathies
of the older people. The young people have grasped the great
significance of Zionism, and have taken a renewed interest in religion, education,
and culture."<a name="FNanchor_42_48" id="FNanchor_42_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_48" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>A renaissance of art is following that of culture; in painting Ephraim
Lilien, Lesser Ury, Judah Epstein, and Hermann Struck, and in marble
and bronze Boris Schatz (the founder and director of Bezalel), Frederick
Beer, and Alfred Nossig are receiving their inspiration from Zionism.</p>

<p>The primary enthusiasm for the movement has long ago been expended;
and the present interest is deep, healthy, and likely to abide. However,
the sustainment of this interest appears to be the primary duty and
task of Zionism; in a movement that is a long, dull, slow pull, every moment
is a critical moment.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Misconceptions of Zionism</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>O the modern Jew who lacks the gift of prophecy, the outcome of an
undertaking must be determined by a consideration not only of the
force propelling the movement, but of the opposition confronting it. A
consideration of this opposition will afford an opportunity, moreover, for
a clear and summarizing definition of what the movement is, and, equally
important, of what it is not. Opposition to Zionism divides itself into
three categories&mdash;ignorant; theoretic; practical. One is reminded of
Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the servant, and Geshem the Arabian, who
mocked and threatened Nehemiah when he undertook to rebuild the walls
of Jerusalem.</div>

<p>Ignorant opposition assails Zionism with arguments that are incontrovertible,
but totally irrelevant; it busies itself with destroying claims
which the Zionists have never made. A trio may be taken as representative.
It is pointed out with cogency that Palestine is not capable of supporting
the twelve million of Jews who inhabit our world; and more conclusively,
the twelve million of Jews do not wish to go to Palestine. Briefly, the
Zionists in seeking a home for the Jew in Canaan no more expect all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Jews to congregate within its bounds than a man who builds himself a
house expects that all his posterity will live in it. As a matter of history,
more Jews after the fall of the first Temple have lived without Palestine
than within. Only a remnant returned after the captivity; and Babylon,
Alexandria, and Rome contained a larger Jewish population than Jerusalem.
Throughout the dispersion, the majority of the Jews lived apart
from the nation center&mdash;whether that center was the Mesapotamia of Talmudic
times, the Spain of the Middle Ages, or the Poland of the early
modern period. The Zionist object is only to secure such a national center
(free from outward pressure) as a ganglion radiating Hebraic culture,
which can preserve Jewish unity and identity and inspire Jewish culture
elsewhere, precisely as the Jud&aelig;a of old rendered similar service;<a name="FNanchor_43_49" id="FNanchor_43_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_49" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and the
modern Palestine with a soil capable of supporting a million inhabitants
without extensive irrigation amply satisfies the Zionist purpose.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Zionism Leaves the Status of the Jew Uninjured</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>C</big>LOSELY allied to this argument is the claim that Zionism constitutes
an abandonment by the European Jew of his hard-earned Emancipation,
and a traitorous retreat from the position of brother and fellow-countryman
which he is now claiming in the several nations. In sum, renationalization
in the East spells de-nationalization in the West, and the return
of the Jew to the status of alien. Such a conclusion follows as
inevitably as it follows that the unification of Germany in 1870 rendered
alien the Germans of America who emigrated here in the '40s, that the
French Revolution denationalized the refugee Huguenot population of
Prussia, that the unification of Italy disfranchised the Italian Swiss, or
that the Irish Home Rule Bill will transform the populace of Boston into
undesirable citizens. On the contrary, the Zionists are convinced that the
re-establishment of a Jewish nation will strengthen, for example, the claim
of the German Jew that he is a German by distinctly separating the
national from the universal Jew&mdash;the sheep from the goats, if you will&mdash;and
will render his status less precarious because it will be more definable.
Moreover, such a national center will increase Jewish self-respect with the
consequence of increasing Christian respect. Jewish "aloofness" need no
longer be a reproach, because it may safely be abandoned; with Zion itself
preserving Hebraism in the East, the Jew in the West may throw himself
unreservedly into the life about him; and a flourishing of Jewish culture
will make his contribution the more valuable.</div>

<p>Finally, the third objection is formulated in the question, "What is
the use?" Whether it be grounded in self-satisfied indifference, hostility,
or a sense of hopelessness, it forms the most insidious opposition, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
it betrays a lack of racial consciousness that cannot be supplied by argument,
and exposes a weakness that cannot be remedied by emotional appeal.
It is a weakness amounting to an absence, a literal lack, of the very
functions through which a cure could be effected. An Englishman asking,
"Why preserve the English?" a Scandinavian asking, "Of what use are
the Scandinavians?" a Swiss asking, "Why maintain Switzerland?" is
inconceivable. Answers indeed can be found, but the point is that to put
the question indicates that the interrogator is beyond a comprehension
of the reply. He is like a congenital blindman, who asks: "Of what
use is seeing?" The question was, indeed, propounded in the third section
of this paper, but only as the hypothetical question of an outsider, much
as an Englishman might ask, "Of what value are the Chinese?" to secure
an external, historical justification of their existence. However, if the
great majority of Jews ever seriously question the need of preserving their
own race, the answer becomes immediate and conclusive; there is no need,
for there is no longer a race.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Zionism Has No Insuperable Obstacles</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HEORETIC opposition is determined on one hand by racial questions,
and on the other by religious dogmas. That the Jews are
no longer a race, that their preservation need not be undertaken because
they do not exist, is, laying aside the scientific disputations, in one sense
begging the question. Whether the Jews are a racial unit, and whether
their preservation will result in a distinct racial culture, is precisely what
a successful consummation of the Zionist object will prove or disprove
with finality; and until such consummation, even scientific theorizing on
the subject will expose itself to the unscientific process of working without
the check of laboratory experiment. To the scientist, Zionism offers Palestine
as such a laboratory. The religious opposition offered by Reform
Judaism has been previously discussed; however, it may be summed up in
three statements. An appeal to the implied meaning of the Scriptures can
only be authoritatively settled by the author. Granting, nevertheless, that
a suffering Israel and a missionary Israel are essentials in a Divine plan,
the establishment of a national center does not dogmatically preclude
Israel from continuing to suffer elsewhere, nor forbid Israel from pursuing
her missionary project of acting as a model example and shining light to
the nations. Quite the reverse; inasmuch as the Dispersion is fast becoming
a Destruction, which Zionism is attempting to avert, the preservation
of Reform Judaism itself demands the success of Zionism.</div>

<p>Practical opposition is indeed ponderous, but not necessarily insuperable.
The majority of Palestinian obstacles, such as the difficulties which
the confusion of national tongues, culture, and habits will impose on unification,
the precarious chance of ultimately securing legal recognition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
from Turkey, the possible obstructions amounting even to conflict to be
offered by the native Arabian population, are distant bridges which the far-seeing
may fear, but which, the wise will not attempt to cross until reached.
However, three urgent perplexities and impediments are imminent in the
danger of securing only a low class of settlers, of suffering from insufficient
means, and of failing from diminution of interest. At bottom, the
three are one, and amount to the necessity of keeping up the old heart and
inspiring new hearts.</p>

<p>With a sufficiency of interest, the necessary money and the proper men
will find their way to Palestine; in a word, only a people can save themselves,
and, failing to do so, aside from scientific argument and religious
dogma, they remain no more a people. That this people may not so perish,
the Zionists are not only furnishing the vision; but with back and arm, they
are working to rebuild the Wall where men have wailed the centuries by.
To the captious, the hostile, and the persistently heedless, their cue is to
say with Nehemiah of old: "I am doing a great work, so that I cannot
come down."</p>

<h2>From College and University</h2>

<h3><i>Activities of Menorah Societies</i></h3>


<div class='center'><b>Brown University</b></div>

<p>The need of some organization based
on ideals that would tend to promote
a closer relationship among
the Jewish students at Brown University
had long been felt on the campus. To
meet this need there has even been an
attempt at uniting the Jewish men by ties
not necessarily Jewish in spirit; happily
this attempt failed. Early in this college
year the Menorah movement was brought
to the attention of the Jewish students
and its aims at once appealed as very
worthy of the serious consideration of
Brown men.</p>

<p>An informal meeting was held and almost
unanimous favor was exhibited for
the establishment of a Menorah Society
at Brown. Whereupon a committee was
elected to interview the authorities of the
University concerning this matter, and
their attitude was found to be all that
could be desired. Steps were then taken
for formal organization, and on the evening
of January 6, 1915, a dedicatory meeting
was held, and the Brown Menorah
Society was launched on its career. (For
an account of this meeting, see the April
<span class="smcap">Menorah Journal</span>, page 140.)</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the Executive Council
formulated a program of activities
for the rest of the year, a program
which has now been successfully carried
through. On February 17, Prof. Richard
Gottheil of Columbia University gave a
very interesting lecture on Zionism. Several
members of the Faculty were present
and took part in the general discussion
that followed the lecture. At the meeting
of March 17, Prof. A. T. Fowler of
the Biblical Department of the University
and a member of the Advisory Board of
the Society, spoke on "The Bible as a
Literary Document." On April 21, Prof.
David G. Lyon of Harvard University
gave an illustrated lecture on "The
Samarian Excavations." This lecture
was given in one of the largest halls of
the University and was open to the public.</p>

<p>The other meetings of the year were
either business meetings or study councils.
At the study councils topics of Jewish interest
were discussed. An informal supper
on the evening of May 20, with election
of officers for the following year,
completed the activities of this year.</p>

<p>The first meeting of the year was held

November 19, 1914, was the biggest event
of the year, the meeting being largely attended
by Jews and non-Jews alike.
Rabbis Stolz and Cohon, representing the
Chicago Rabbinical Society, also delivered
short talks.</p>

<p>Hitherto, the Menorah Society has been
unknown to have other than quite formal
lectures. No attempt has been made to
make the members feel at home and more
sociable at the meetings. An innovation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
was tried when, at the meeting on May
10, there was an informal talk by Dr.
Joseph Stolz, of the Isaiah Temple of
Chicago, on Hillel, which was followed
not only by discussion but also by refreshments.
This meeting was a complete success.
It was followed by another informal
meeting on Maimonides.</p>

<p>The last meeting was a "get-together"
meeting of the Society to discuss plans for
the next year. Suggestions were accepted
to interest incoming freshmen by personal
letters and visits and "get-acquainted"
and "enthusiasm" gatherings. It is reasonable
to hope from the increasing membership
and the suggestions for future action
that the Menorah will become more
and more powerful on the campus, especially
with the encouragement and the aid
of the alumni in Chicago, who are planning
to have also a graduate Menorah
organization.</p>

<p>The second year, just closed, of the
Clark Menorah Society has been
most successful. At the weekly
meetings, papers were given by various
members on such subjects as Reform
Judaism, Orthodoxy, Zionism, Assimilation,
which were followed by entertaining
and instructive discussions. Reports were
also given by members on current books
of Jewish interest, among them being:
Fishberg's "The Jews," Ruppin's "The
Jews of Today," and Israel Cohen's
"Jewish Life in Modern Times." Current
magazine articles of Jewish interest
were also reviewed and discussed.</p>

<p>Members of the Faculty and outside

at various times and Rabbi H. H.
Rubenovitz of Boston delivered a series
of lectures on "The Maccabees."</p>

<p>The first banquet of the Society, held

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>T the beginning of this year conditions
were somewhat abnormal
for the Illinois Menorah Society.
The preceding graduating class had taken
an extraordinarily heavy toll from our
members and, as the number of Juniors
left was small, we had few veterans remaining.
But, to offset our loss, we were
compensated by an unusually large number
of promising freshmen.</div>

<p>We started the year with a reception
to the new students at which over one
hundred were present. Our customary
smoker was dispensed with on account of
the increased number of Jewish co-eds,
there being about fifteen at present. At
our next meeting, at which we formally
welcomed the new students to our Society,
Dr. David S. Blondheim of our Faculty
explained the nature of the work we are
doing and gave some practical advice, and
Dr. Jacob Zeitlin of our Faculty spoke
on the Jewish problems of the present.
Since then we have had many regular
meetings, every other Sunday, student
programs alternating with outside speakers.
Among the latter have been Professor
I. Leo Sharfman of Michigan, who
spoke on "Jewish Ideals," Rabbi A. A.
Neuman of the Dropsie College, who
talked on "Life Among Medieval Spanish
Jews," and Dr. H. M. Kallen of Wisconsin
on "The Meaning of Hebraism."
Mrs. E. F. Nickoley, who has traveled
extensively in Palestine, gave an interesting
talk on the Jews in the Holy Land.
Professor Simon Litman of our Faculty
spoke on "Jews and Modern Capitalism."
Professor E. C. Baldwin of our English
department, in speaking on "Prayer,"
roused a lively interest in the question as
to whether prayer is decadent among the
Jews. Professor Albert H. Lybyer lectured
on "Jews as the Transmitters of
Culture from the Moslems to the Christians";
Professor Boyd H. Bode discussed
"What the Jew Contributes to
American Ideals," and Dr. A. R. Vail
spoke on "The Influence of the Hebrew
Prophets as the Teachers of Moral Law."</p>

<p>Nor have we had a dearth of student
talks and readings, among them the following:
Herbert B. Rosenberg on the
Falashas, Louis Ribback on the Chinese
Jews, Jesse Block on the Spanish Jews,
S. J. Lurie on Maimonides, Julius Cohen
on "The Jewish Messianic Idea," L. J.
Greengard on "Prophecy," Karl Epstein
on Jewish Nationalism. Current events
were given during the year by Bertha
Bing, Julius Cohen, and William A.
Grossman.</p>

<p>Early in February a study circle was
formed, under the leadership of Mrs.
Simon Litman, for the study of post-Biblical
Jewish history. Ten members of the
Society enrolled and met weekly at the
home of Professor and Mrs. Litman.
Portions of Vol. II of Graetz and of
Riggs' "History of the Jews" were read
and amplified by the excellent lectures of
the leader. The discussions also furnished
very valuable instruction.</p>

<div class='unindent'><big>D</big>URING the past year the conditions
on the campus were such that it
made all of the Jewish students
feel the necessity of the right kind of
Jewish organization. Clubs had been
formed time after time, each of a different
nature; yet none of them could fulfill
the need and they all sooner or later broke
up. Thus things dragged along, each one
feeling that something ought to be done,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
yet no one knowing what remedy was
needed, until a report came of the Menorah
movement. After a hastily gathered
meeting one Saturday night, the matter
was presented to the Jewish students
for discussion. Great enthusiasm was displayed
and everybody was heartily in favor
of organizing a Menorah Society.</div>

<p>With the aid of the Menorah catalogue
("The Menorah Movement"), and Mr.
Joseph Spear, of our Faculty, a former
member of the Harvard Menorah Society,
a constitution was drawn up and presented
at the next meeting, when it was accepted.
It was also submitted to President
Aley, who approved it and congratulated
us most heartily upon the formation
of the Society.</p>

<p>Our first task was to place the Society
in the right light on the campus by emphasizing
the absolutely unsectarian,
academic, cultural nature of the Menorah
Society and the fact that membership is
invitingly open to all members of the University.
In this we were greatly helped
by the visit of Chancellor Henry Hurwitz
who addressed the whole student
body in Chapel on the morning of May
5th, after being introduced by President
Aley, upon the nature and purposes of the
Menorah movement; and he addressed a
public meeting of the Society in the evening,
which was also attended by President
Aley, on "Jewish Ideals."</p>

<p>During the course of the year we have
succeeded in holding several other enthusiastic
meetings besides. We have had
frank and inspiring talks by President
Aley and Professor Huddleston. At other
meetings our own members gave talks
and discussions. Thus, Samuel Rudman
gave a splendid talk on "The Attitude of
Jewish Young Men towards Jewish Religion",
which was warmly discussed. Another
paper was delivered by A. I. Schwey
on "Hebrew Literature."</p>

<p>Through the kindness of the Intercollegiate
Menorah Association, into which we
were admitted at the Cincinnati Convention,
we have secured a Menorah Library,
which has been put in a conspicuous
place in the reading room of the University
library, for the benefit of all the students.
But the Menorah members especially
intend to make good use of the books
in the preparation of papers and in regular
study. We have also been fortunate
in securing a set of the Jewish Encyclopedia
from Mr. Cyrus L. Sulzberger of
New York for presentation to the University
library. The coming of the Encyclopedia
and the Menorah Library has
been greatly appreciated by the authorities,
and the Maine Menorah Society is happy
to have been able already to be of concrete
service to the University. All of our activities
have caused favorable interest on
the part of both the student body and the
college authorities, and a great change has
come about in the attitude towards the
Jewish men. We look forward to even
greater progress as well as hard work in
the future.</p>

<div class='unindent'><big>O</big>UR Menorah Society this year has
done at least two things. First, it
has definitely held to a program
of work; secondly, it has become accredited
as representative of the Jewish students
to the Jewish students themselves, and even
more to the non-Jews. The opposition that
some of the students manifested in other
years has not been so active, and the Society
drew a large proportion of them,
sometimes all of them, to its meetings.
The non-Jews, especially among the Faculty,
have exhibited an actively interested
and helpful attitude. In this connection,
our thanks are due Prof. J. E. Wrench,
of the History department, whose presence
at all of our meetings greatly stimulated
profitable discussion.</div>

<p>Of the Jewish faculty men, Dr. Henry
M. Sheffer, of the Philosophy department,
one of the founders of the Harvard Menorah
Society, took a particularly active
interest in the work, especially in the preparation
of our programs. The program
for the second semester was on "Typical
Hebraic Ideals", as follows:</p>

</table></div>

<p>This program was devised with the
idea of creating a definite reaction to
Hebraism. So, the papers on Hellenism
and Emancipation tried by the contrast
of transitional periods to make Hebraic
ideals as a whole stand out. The meeting
on Reform and Orthodoxy was devoted
to an historical analysis of the forces underlying
the present situation in Judaism.
The papers on Zionism and Assimilation,
again, summed up from another angle the
characteristics of Hebraic aspiration. And
at the two last meetings, present Jewish
life and ideals were discussed in terms of
their literary and philosophical expression.</p>

<p>Along with these meetings we had several
lectures by Dr. H. M. Sheffer, Rabbi
A. A. Neuman of the Dropsie College, and
Dr. H. M. Kallen of Wisconsin. These
meetings were in every case productive of
great enthusiasm. Prof. J. E. Wrench
addressed a meeting composed in numbers
equally of Jews and non-Jews on "The
Jew and Christian in the Middle Ages",
and we also had an address by Dr. A. T.
Olmstead, Professor of Ancient History,
on the "Book of Kings".</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>University of North Carolina</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE Menorah Society at our University
is in a unique position. The
number of Jews in North Carolina
is the smallest of any in the Southern
States. Only in a few places is there any
organized Jewish life. The Jewish students
come chiefly from such places where
the number of Jews is very small. Under
these circumstances, it can readily be seen
how difficult it was at first to implant the
idea of a Jewish society for the purpose
of the study of Jewish subjects of which
the majority of the students were greatly
ignorant. The Society, however, has now
passed far beyond the experimental stage.
All the Jewish students at North Carolina
now show a great deal of interest and enthusiasm
in the Menorah work.</div>

<p>From the fact that our Society can look
to very little in the way of help from any
Jewish community in the State, and that
it is far from any Jewish cultural center
in the South, it can be perceived how hard
it was at first to carry on our work in
comparison with our sister Societies located
in more favorable localities. A review
of our work of the last term will
show, however, gratifying results. Our
method was similar to that of the class
room. A text book on Jewish history was
taken as the basis for study, supplemented
by additional information from the Jewish
Encyclopedia and other books on Judaica
from the University Library and the
Menorah Library. The value of our
study of Jewish history may be educed
from the fact that most of us had but the
faintest knowledge of our glorious past.
When a thorough knowledge of the text
was acquired, discussions and studies of
different phases and movements in Judaism
were taken up. In this work the Menorah
Library proved an especially valuable aid.</p>

<p>While our Society is not a religious organization,
it endeavors to surround our
work with ethical and religious aims. The
Society tries to be here for the Jewish
students what the Y. M. C. A. is in a
measure for our Christian fellow-students,
and we can say that it has succeeded in
its endeavor. The relation of the Menorah
Society here with the Y. M. C. A.
is one of heartiest co-operation.</p>
