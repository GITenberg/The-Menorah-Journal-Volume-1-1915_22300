Present subscribers may secure this gift by remitting now for an extension

<h3>You Would, Wouldn't You&mdash;?</h3>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>F you knew that there was a tiny little book, just
large enough to slip into your pocket, that you
could read through in a few trolley-car or train
rides&mdash;and when you got through have an intelligent,
broad, philosophic grasp of the entire
history of the Jews&mdash;not just a lot of names and
dates, you know, but the big vital facts that count and that
you can remember and talk about, and never be embarrassed
by ignorance,&mdash;and best of all, if you could get a little wonder
book like that for just 40 cents, you'd send for it quick,
wouldn't you?</div>

<p>Well we have just such a book, all ready for you&mdash;Paul
Goodman's little "<i>History of the Jews</i>"&mdash;in the Temple Classics
(the little books, you remember, that made Shakespere famous)&mdash;beautifully
bound, a joy to handle, and a greater joy to read.
Just write your name and address on this ad, tear it out, and
mail to The Menorah Journal, 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New
York (with 40 cents in stamps for each copy you want&mdash;you
can have as many as you like&mdash;they make dandy little gifts,&mdash;we'll

instantly aroused by
the simple beauty of
the Kranich &amp; Bach
Grand, are confirmed
and enhanced by the
exquisite tone of this
matchless instrument.
Words can
convey little
conception of
the artistic superiority of the
Kranich &amp; Bach Small Grand.
Although only 5'4" long it
produces, in a manner almost
unbelievable, all the magnificent qualities of tone that make
"grands" infinitely more satisfying than "upright" pianos. With
its new full-tone scale and the marvelous "Isotonic Pedal," this
superb instrument IS the Small Grand leader of the world&mdash;<i>supreme
and incomparable</i>.</div>

<div class='unindent'><big>D</big>EEP in his soul he began to feel the need of being a Jew.
His circumstances were not unsatisfactory; he enjoyed
an ample income and a profession that permitted him to
do whatever his heart desired. For he was an artist. His Jewish
origin and the faith of his fathers had long since ceased to
trouble him, when suddenly the old hatred came to the surface
again in a new mob-cry. With many others he believed that this
flood would shortly subside. But there was no change for the
better; in fact, things went from bad to worse; and every blow,
even though not aimed directly at him, struck him with fresh
pain, till little by little his soul became one bleeding wound.
These sorrows, buried deep in his heart and silenced there, evoked
thoughts of their origin and of his Judaism, and now he did something
he could not perhaps have done in the old days because he
was then so alien to it&mdash;he began to love this Judaism with an
intense fervor. Although in his own eyes he could not, at first,
clearly justify this new yearning, it became so powerful at length
that it crystallized from vague emotions into a definite idea which
he must needs express. It was the conviction that there was only
one solution for this <i>Judennot</i>&mdash;the return to Judaism.</div>

<p>When this came to the knowledge of his closest friends,
similarly situated though they were, they shook their heads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
gravely and even feared for his reason. For how could that be
a remedy which merely sharpened and intensified the evil? It
seemed to him, on the other hand, that their moral distress
was so acute because the Jew of to-day had lost the poise which
was his father's very being. They ridiculed him for this when
his back was turned&mdash;many even laughed openly in his face; yet
he did not allow himself to be misled by the banalities of these
people whose acuteness of judgment had never before inspired
his respect, and he bore their witticisms and their sneers with
equal indifference. And since, in all other respects, he acted
like a man in his senses, they suffered him gradually to indulge
in his infatuation, which a number of them soon began to call
by a harsher term than <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i>.</p>
<p>He continued, however, with characteristic persistence to
develop one idea after another from his fundamental conviction.
At this time he was profoundly moved by several instances of
apostasy, though his pride would not permit him to betray it. As
a man and as an artist of the modern school, he had, of course,
acquired many non-Jewish habits and his study of the cultures of
successive civilizations had left an indelible impress upon him.
How was this to be reconciled with his return to Judaism?
Often doubts assailed him as to the soundness of his guiding
thought, his "id&eacute;e ma&icirc;tresse," as a French thinker calls it. Perhaps
this generation, having grown up under the influence of
alien cultures, was no longer capable of that return which he
had perceived to be their redemption. But the new generation
would be capable of it, if it were only given the right direction
early enough. He resolved, therefore, that his own children, at
least, should be shown the proper path. They should be trained
as Jews in their own home.</p>

<p>Hitherto he had permitted to pass by unobserved the holiday
which the wonderful apparition of the Maccabees had illumined
for thousands of years with the glow of miniature lights.
Now, however, he made this holiday an opportunity to prepare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
something beautiful which should be forever commemorated in
the minds of his children. In their young souls should be implanted
early a steadfast devotion to their ancient people. He
bought a Menorah, and when he held this nine-branched candlestick
in his hands for the first time, a strange mood came
over him. In his father's house also, the lights had once burned
in his youth, now far away, and the recollection gave him a sad
and tender feeling for home. The tradition was neither cold nor
dead,&mdash;thus it had passed through the ages, one light kindling
another. Moreover, the ancient form of the Menorah had excited
his interest. When was the primitive structure of this candlestick
fashioned? Clearly the design was suggested by the tree&mdash;in
the centre the sturdy trunk, on right and left four branches, one
below the other, in one plane, and all of equal height. A later
symbolism brought with it the short ninth branch, which projects
in front and functions as a servant. What mystery had
the generations which followed one another read into this form
of art, at once so simple and natural? And our artist wondered
to himself if it were not possible to animate again the withered
form of the Menorah, to water its roots, as one would a tree.
The mere sound of the name, which he now pronounced every
evening to his children, gave him great pleasure. There was a
lovable ring to the word when it came from the lips of little
children.</p>
<p>On the first night the candle was lit and the origin of the
holiday explained. The wonderful incident of the lights that
strangely remained burning so long, the story of the return
from the Babylonian exile, the second Temple, the Maccabees&mdash;our
friend told his children all he knew. It was not very much,
to be sure, but it served. When the second candle was lit, they
repeated what he had told them, and though it had all been
learned from him, it seemed to him quite new and beautiful. In
the days that followed he waited keenly for the evenings, which
became ever brighter. Candle after candle stood in the Menorah,
and the father mused on the little candles with his children,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
till at length his reflections became too deep to be uttered
before them.</p><p>When he had resolved to return to his people and to make
open acknowledgment of his return, he had only thought he
would be doing the honorable and rational thing. But he had never
dreamed that he would find in it a gratification of his yearning
for the beautiful. Yet nothing less was his good fortune. The
Menorah with its many lights became a thing of beauty to inspire
lofty thought. So, with his practised hand, he drew a
plan for a Menorah to present to his children the following
year. He made free use of the motif of the eight branching
arms projecting right and left in one plane from the central
stem. He did not hold himself bound by the rigid traditional
form, but created directly from nature, unconcerned by other
symbolisms also seeking expression. He was on the search for
living beauty. Yet, though he gave the withered branch new
life, he conformed to the law, to the gentle dignity, of its being.
It was a tree with slender branches; its ends were moulded into
flower calyxes which would hold the lights.</p>

<p>The week passed with this absorbing labor. Then came the
eighth day, when the whole row burns, even the faithful ninth,
the servant, which on other nights is used only for the lighting
of the others. A great splendor streamed from the Menorah.
The children's eyes glistened. But for our friend all this was
the symbol of the enkindling of a nation. When there is but
one light all is still dark, and the solitary light looks melancholy.
Soon it finds one companion, then another, and another.
The darkness must retreat. The light comes first to the young
and the poor,&mdash;then others join them who love Justice, Truth,
Liberty, Progress, Humanity, and Beauty. When all the candles
burn, then we must all stand and rejoice over the achievement.
And no office can be more blessed than that of a Servant of the
Light.</p>

<h2>The Present Crisis in American Jewry</h2>

<div class='center'><i>A Plea for Reconciliation</i></div>

and Poland." His lectures before

and have made him a great

<div class='unindent'><big>V</big>ARIOUS occurrences of recent date have revealed
a rift in American Jewry which if not
healed in time is likely to result in a permanent
schism. The agitation centering around the question
of a Jewish Congress is not the cause of this rift; it is
rather an effect or a symptom betokening the profound
difference of opinion and sentiment which at
present divides the Jews of America. In the realignment
of American Jewry which this struggle is calling
forth, the Zionists and the non-Zionists of this
country&mdash;the former centering around their local
organization, the latter represented by the American
Jewish Committee&mdash;have been taking opposite sides.
Those of us whose Judaism is broad enough to embrace
with equal loyalty the ideals of Zionism and the
interests of American Judaism, cannot but view with
the deepest concern the possibility of a permanent
conflict between these two sections of American Jewry,
a conflict fraught with the gravest consequences,
not only for the Jewish cause in this country in general
but also for the Zionist movement&mdash;a conflict,
moreover, in which no victory achieved by either side
can be anything but a Pyrrhic victory.</div>

<p>The situation is one that demands careful thought
and delicate action. Only a few of us are in a position
to influence the course of events by acting, but
many of us may help to clarify the situation by thinking.
A correct diagnosis is an indispensable preliminary
to a cure, and it is only by finding out
whether the issues underlying the present struggle
represent a chronic and perhaps irremediable conflict,
or are rather the effect of an acute and therefore
curable misunderstanding, that a proper solution may be discovered and
proposed. It is from this point of view that an attempt is here made to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
analyze the present situation in American Jewry, to trace the causes which
have produced it, and to point out the consequences which are unavoidable
unless a remedy be applied in time.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Two Issues in American Jewry</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>O my mind there are two fundamental issues which separate the two
groups in American Jewry from one another. They may be expressed
in the following terms: 1, <i>Diaspora versus Palestine;</i> 2, <i>Religion
versus Nationalism</i>.</div>

<p>Without any desire to lose myself in philosophic subtleties, I shall, for
the sake of brevity, adopt the Hegelian language and explain the development
of these issues on the principle of <i>Thesis</i>, <i>Antithesis</i> and <i>Synthesis</i>,
i. e., of the initial prevalence of one extreme, of its yielding subsequently
to the opposite extreme, and of the final harmonization of the two in a
higher unity, combining the essential features of both. I shall endeavor
to point out that the Synthesis forms the ground on which both parties may
cooperate, without sacrificing an iota of their respective convictions.</p>

<p>The first issue, expressed in the formula "Diaspora versus Palestine,"
hinges on the question as to whether the Jewish people finds its best opportunities
for development in the Diaspora, i. e., as an integral part of the
nations in whose midst it lives, or, away from the other nations, as a separate
entity, on its own soil in Palestine.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Rise and Fall of "Diaspora Judaism"</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>W</big>HEN modern Jewry, after the isolation of centuries, suddenly
emerged from the Ghetto to seek a place in the sun in the midst
of the Christian environment, the thesis adopted by it was <i>Diaspora</i>.
Consumed with the desire for emancipation, for sharing the benefits and
attractions of the new life around them, the Jews discarded the hope for an
independent national existence in Palestine, which had been their lode-star
throughout the ages. <i>Diaspora</i> as opposed to <i>Palestine</i>, and as exclusive of
it, became the slogan of emancipated Jewry. The Jewish religion was refitted
to harmonize with this new striving for material and cultural
progress. Reform Judaism arose, the main object of which was to break
down the previous separateness of the Jews; and the theory of a "Jewish
mission" sprang into life, not as a spontaneous growth of Jewish tradition,
but as a forced hothouse product of practical life&mdash;a theory which proclaimed
that an isolated Jewish existence in Palestine was subversive of the
very essence of Judaism, that the mission of the Jewish people was to propagate
monotheism among the nations of the earth, and that this mission
could only be carried out in the Dispersion, in the midst of the nations
which were to be the objects of that mission.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></div>

<p>As time progressed, however, the "Diaspora" thesis gradually lost its
force. Emancipation failed to fulfill the ardent hopes attached to it. The
nations refused to allow the Jews to participate fully and unrestrictedly
in the general life of the country. Anti-Semitism, manifesting itself in the
crude form of hatred, or under the subtle guise of prejudice, turned, in
many cases, the liberties previously granted to the Jews into a scrap of
paper. On the other hand, the dangers of this extreme Diaspora Judaism,
at first little thought of, began to loom larger and larger. The rush for
emancipation threatened not only to disrupt the unity of the Jewish people
throughout the world, which had been maintained during the ages of suffering
and persecution, but it also led large and important sections of
Jewry to assimilation, that is, to complete absorption.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Antithesis "Palestine" and Its Inadequacy</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>S a protest against the thesis "Diaspora," its opposite came to life,
the antithesis "Palestine." Political Zionism sprang into being,
loudly proclaiming that emancipation was a failure; that Judaism had no
chance of life in the Dispersion, and that the only salvation of Jewry lay
in being transferred to Palestine. <i>Zionism or assimilation</i> was the alternative
placed before the Jewish people. All efforts of Jewry, as the last attempt
to escape annihilation, were to be focused on the obtaining of a publicly
and legally assured home in Palestine. All Jewish endeavors in the
Diaspora were deprecated, because consecrated to a cause which was foredoomed
to failure.</div>

<p>It was not long before the antithesis, too, began to reveal its deficiencies.
The difficulties of reaching the Zionist goal very soon proved far greater
than had been anticipated in the blissful ecstasy of the Zionist honeymoon.
The ultimate consummation of the national hope receded further and
further before the longing gaze of the Jewish people, and no longer held
out an immediate remedy for the pressing needs of suffering Jewry. The
conviction also gradually gained ground that, even under the most favorable
of circumstances, Palestine could only harbor a fraction of the Jewish,
people, and that the vast bulk of Jews would still remain in the lands of
the Diaspora. Zionists who were looking reality in the face could not accept
the view of the extremists, who were ready to save a small portion of
the Jewish people at the cost of abandoning to its fate the enormous majority
thereof.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Opposing Ideals Fused Into Spiritual Zionism</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>S a result, a new formula asserted itself: Diaspora <i>plus</i> Palestine. It
was the combination between the two extremes of Diaspora existence
and Palestine existence. This synthesis, generally called Cultural or Spiritual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Zionism, proclaimed that Palestine was indispensable for the continuation
of Judaism, for it was the only spot where the spirit of Judaism, undisturbed
by conflicting influences, could develop normally and unfold all its
hidden possibilities, and the only bond of unity which could save the scattered
members of the race from falling asunder into disjointed fragments.
The Diaspora, on the other hand, as the dwelling place of the overwhelming
majority of the Jewish people, had problems of its own which clamored
equally for solution.</div>

<p>Hence the Jewish task became a double one: the Jews in every
country, while participating to the full in the life of their environment&mdash;for
the return to the Ghetto was neither desirable nor possible&mdash;had
to endeavor to secure a maximum of elbowroom for the development of their
own section of Jewry, while as part of universal Israel they had to keep up
their contact with the Jews throughout the world and labor with them for
the realization of the common Jewish hope, that of a spiritual center in the
historic land of Judaism. <i>Diaspora without Palestine</i> was impossible, because
without the refreshing breath of a healthy Jewish life in Palestine it
was bound to wither and dry up. <i>Palestine without the Diaspora</i> was
equally impossible, because it lacked the backing of the people as a whole,
and was in danger of becoming a petty and obscure corner in the vast expanse
of the Jewish Dispersion, a sort of Jewish Nigeria.</p>

<p>This synthesis was not a pale cast of thought, the flimsy product of an
imaginative brain. It had its prototype in the actual facts of history.
For during several centuries preceding the dissolution of the Jewish state,
Palestine was the spiritual center of Judaism, in the sense just indicated.
The Jews outside of Palestine were superior, not only in numbers, but also
in wealth and influence, to those of Palestine. The Jews of Egypt, and the
same applies to other countries of that period, were closely associated with
the cultural and material aspirations of their environment. Philo was one
of the most illustrious representatives of the Hellenic culture of his age;
these Diaspora Jews even found it necessary to translate the Holy Writings
into Greek. Yet they were, at the same time, loyal to Palestine. They
paid their Shekel, they made their annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem, and
looked upon the Holy Land as the spiritual center of all Jewry.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Second Issue: Religion vs. Nationalism</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE other fundamental issue on which Jewish opinion is divided is
closely associated with the preceding one; it hinges on the formula
<i>Religion versus Nationalism</i>. From its earliest beginnings down to the
time of modern emancipation, Judaism represented an indissoluble combination
of nationalism and religion. Though ultimately intended to appeal
to the whole of humanity, Judaism was essentially a <i>national</i> religion. Its
bearer was a national community which zealously guarded its racial purity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and its external manifestations assumed the forms of a national life. Again
the Jewish people was, first and foremost, a <i>religious</i> nation. Its sole
reason for existence was, in the belief of every one of its members, "to know
the Lord" and to make Him known to others. A Jew who did not believe
in the fundamentals of the Jewish creed or who did not observe the fundamentals
of the Jewish ceremonial was as much of a monstrosity as the Jew
who denied the common racial descent of the Jews in the past, or their
common national destiny in the future.</div>

<p>The departure of the Jews from the Ghetto and their entrance into
modern life marked a turning point also in this direction. Filled with the
desire of becoming part of the nations in whose midst they lived, modern
Jews were ready, and thought they were compelled, to deny the national
character of Judaism. The Jews were now labelled as Germans or Frenchmen
of the Mosaic persuasion, who were divided from their fellow-citizens
by the purely spiritual affiliations of religious faith&mdash;the same affiliations
which divided the Christian population. Here, too, Reform Judaism was
quick to meet the demands of practical life. It began to chop off all the
elements in Judaism which betrayed a national character, both in the
domain of doctrine and of practice, though it halted half way, and down
to this day still acknowledges, in flagrant contradiction with its own theory,
a number of rites and ceremonies which bear an unmistakable racial imprint.</p>

<p>This transformation of Judaism, or rather this transformation of Jewish
terminology&mdash;for, in many cases, it was merely a question of terms&mdash;was
greatly stimulated by the development of nationalism in Western
Europe, where the structure of the modern state excluded, or was thought
to exclude, a diversity of nationalities, while the principle of religious
toleration left enough room for a variety of religious beliefs. As a result,
those Jews who lost their religious affiliations were bound to feel that
they were outcasts in the religious community of Israel: they became
either <i>konfessionslos</i> or, by a curious perversion of logic and conscience,
became members of the dominant faith.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Rapprochement of Religionists and Nationalists</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE thesis "Judaism as Religion" was followed by the antithesis
"Judaism as Nationalism." It is interesting to observe that the antithesis
came from the Jews of Eastern Europe who, in their overwhelming
majority, were adherents of strict orthodoxy. Those Jews of Russia and Poland
who had drifted away from their religious moorings were neither psychologically
nor physically in a position to abandon Judaism: psychologically,
because they were too strongly saturated with Jewish culture and Jewish
associations to tear themselves away from the influence of Judaism;
physically, because they were excluded from participating in the life of the
environment and were forced to remain within the fold. Living as the Eastern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Jews did in compact masses, they found it easier, both in theory and in
practice, to emphasize the national aspect of the Jewish community. As a
result, a doctrine sprang up which looked upon Jewry as an essentially
racial or national entity, in which religion was merely one of the many passing
phases of its historical development. If among the champions of the
thesis "Religion" there were Jews who celebrated the Ninth of Ab as a
holiday because it marked, in their eyes, the end of Jewry as a nation, there
were, among the others, the adherents of the antithesis "Nationalism,"
Jews who arranged entertainments on the Day of Atonement, as a public
protest against the religious character ascribed to Judaism.</div>

<p>Here, too, however, the synthesis was gradually paving its way, and the
formula "Religion <i>plus</i> Nationalism" was supplanting the thesis "Judaism
as Religion" and the antithesis "Judaism as Nationalism." The religionists,
that is, the believers in the purely religious character of Judaism, began
to realize the devastating effect of their doctrine on Jewish life and
development, while the nationalists, without sacrificing their convictions&mdash;for
religion, least of all sentiments, can be forced on modern men&mdash;began
to appreciate the overwhelming influence of the Jewish religion as a historic
factor in the life of the Jewish people, and were ready to acknowledge the
difficulty and the danger of squeezing an officially nationalistic Jewry into
the narrow frame of the modern <i>Nationalstaat</i>.</p>

<p>This mutual <i>rapprochement</i> resulted, gradually, in a tacit agreement&mdash;an
agreement far more durable than a legal compact, because founded on
sentiment rather than on law&mdash;which implied the recognition of Judaism as
composed of Religion and Nationalism, but left sufficient room to include
the two extreme types of Jews: those whose loyalty to Judaism was entirely
fed from the fountain of religion, and those whose devotion to Judaism
was altogether grounded in race consciousness.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Growth of Diaspora Judaism in America</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HIS development, which may be traced in various countries of modern
Europe, nowhere assumed such huge proportions and such striking
manifestations as it did in America. The struggle, hinging on the two opposite
doctrines, was nowhere else so well defined and nowhere else fraught
with so many tangible consequences as in America, for the reason that
American Jewry, as no other Jewry in the world, was made up of two
different elements, sharply divided in their traditions and associations, as
well as in their mental and psychological complexion. The Jews hailing
from the lands of emancipation in Western Europe, who are conventionally,
though not quite accurately, designated as German Jews, brought over
with them the theses <i>Diaspora</i> as against <i>Palestine</i>, and <i>Religion</i> as against
<i>Nationalism</i>. The immigrants from Eastern Europe, the children of the
Ghetto, who with equal inaccuracy are termed Russian Jews, carried with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
them the antitheses <i>Palestine</i> as against <i>Diaspora</i> and, as represented by
the extremists among them, <i>Nationalism</i> as against <i>Religion</i>. The fanatics
of Diaspora Judaism and of Judaism as a pure faith are to be found exclusively
among the "German" Jews. The radical adherents of Palestine
and of Jewish nationalism are recruited entirely from the ranks of
"Russian" Jews.</div>

<p>These issues were of particular and immediate significance for the Jews
in this country; for America has, in less than one generation, become the
second largest center of the Jewish Diaspora, and bids fair to become the
first, instead of the second, within another generation. No other country
in the world offers, even approximately, such a favorable combination of
opportunities for the development of a Diaspora Judaism, as does America:
economic possibilities, vast and sparsely populated territories, freedom of
action, liberty of conscience, equality of citizenship, appreciation of the
fundamentals of Judaism, variety of population, excluding a rigidly nationalistic
state policy, and other similar factors. It is no wonder, therefore,
that in no other country did Reform Judaism, as the incarnation of
Diaspora Judaism, attain such luxurious growth as it did in America. It
discarded, more radically than in Europe, the national elements still clinging
to Judaism, and it solemnly proclaimed that Judaism was wholly and
exclusively a religious faith, and that America was the Zion and Washington
the Jerusalem of American Israel.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Opposition: The Palestinian Sentiment of Russian Jews</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>O</big>N the other hand, the emigrants from Russia brought the antithesis on
the scene. They quickly perceived the decomposing effect of American
life upon Jewish doctrine and practice, and they became convinced
more firmly than ever that Diaspora Judaism was a failure, and that the
only antidote was Palestine and nothing but Palestine. The nationalists
among them beheld in the very same factors in which the German Jews saw
the possibilities of a Diaspora Judaism, the chances for organizing Jewry
on purely nationalistic lines. Nowhere else, except perhaps in Russia, can
be found a greater amount of Palestinian sentiment, as well as a larger manifestation
of a one-sided Jewish nationalism, than is to be met with in this
country.</div>

<p>This conflict of ideas became extraordinarily aggravated by numerous
influences of a personal character. The division between the so-called German
Jews and the so-called Russian Jews was not limited to a difference in
theory. It was equally nourished by far-reaching differences in economic
and social position and in the entire range of mental development. The
German Jews were the natives; the Russian Jews were the newcomers. The
German Jews were the rich; the Russian Jews were the poor. The German
Jews were the dispensers of charity; the Russian Jews were the receivers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of it. The German Jews were the employers; the Russian Jews were the
employees. The German Jews were deliberate, reserved, practical, sticklers
for formalities, with a marked ability for organization; the Russian Jews
were quick-tempered, emotional, theorizing, haters of formalities, with a
decided bent toward individualism. An enormous amount of explosives
had been accumulating between the two sections, which if lit by a spark
might have disrupted the edifice of American Israel, still in the process of
construction.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Promise of Union and Harmony</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>ND yet, not only was the conflict averted, but the impending struggle
gave way to hearty and extensive cooperation, such as cannot be
witnessed elsewhere in the whole Jewish world (one recalls particularly
the analogy of England) where East and West seem never to meet.
As the two sections came into closer contact with one another, they learned
to understand one another and to appreciate their respective points of
view. This cooperation was not founded upon the flimsy framework of
political expediency. It was grounded in that synthesis of Jewish life which
combines in a higher unity the essential elements of the doctrines formerly
believed to be exclusive of one another. The German Jews, while emphasizing
the needs of Diaspora Judaism and anxious to build up its largest manifestation
in America, learned to appreciate the quickening and ennobling
effect upon the Diaspora of a normal Hebrew life in Palestine, and became
interested in the regeneration of the Holy Land. The Russian Jews, on
the other hand, though laying particular stress on the possibilities of Judaism
in Palestine, put their shoulder to the wheel and were ready to assist
in rearing the great structure of Judaism in America. The so-called
religionists, while looking upon Judaism as a faith, were yet disinclined to
repudiate the purely nationalistic Jews, whose enthusiasm and devotion
they admired even though it flowed from a source they did not officially
acknowledge. The so-called nationalists, basing their Judaism on race
consciousness, realized that a common foundation of Judaism in this
country could only be laid along the lines of religious affiliation.</div>

<p>This cooperation found tangible expression in the recent participation
of American Jews in the upbuilding of Palestine, a participation which one
will vainly look for in a similar group (I am not speaking of isolated individuals)
in other countries. The same desire for a better understanding
was further embodied in the movement toward Kehillah organization,
which, though centering around the Jewish religion, still clearly implied the
national element in Judaism.</p>

<p>There was every reason to hope that this cooperation, which had been
so happily inaugurated between the two sections, would become more intimate
and more extensive, and that the interaction of the heterogeneous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
elements of American Jewish life would resolve itself in a great and strong
harmony. America bade fair to become an ideal Jewish center, where the
practical wisdom of emancipated Jewry and the idealistic intensity of
Ghetto Jewry would be merged in one united Jewish community, fully conscious
of its duty as the future leader of the Jewish Diaspora and acknowledging
its indebtedness to the center of all Jews in the land of our Fathers.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Old Conflict Revived</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>S</big>UDDENLY, however, a reaction seems to have set in, which threatens
to disrupt the harmony hitherto prevailing. This reaction, which is
fraught with grave consequences for the future of American Judaism no
less than for the Zionist movement, dates from, or at least coincides with,
the struggle centering around the Haifa Technikum. This is not the place
to enter into an analysis of that momentous issue. It is enough to state
that the bond of unity was disrupted with rude hands, and the old conflict
hinging on the issues of Diaspora and Nationalism broke out with new
fury. Again we see Diaspora Judaism pitched against Palestinian Judaism,
and Religion against Nationalism. Reason has given way to passion,
and discrimination to generalization. The Jews of the new Palestine, who
have given of their life-blood to the rejuvenation of our homeland, are
sweepingly declared to be "anarchists," while, on the other hand, American
Jews who, with single-hearted devotion, have been the builders of the great
Jewish center in the New World, are contemptuously sneered at as "assimilationists."</div>

<p>In this mood of distrust and prejudice, American Jewry was overtaken
by the great crisis resulting from the World War, and the disharmony prevailing
between the two factions soon found tangible expression in the
struggle over a Jewish Congress. The two elements of American Jewry
were clearly divided on the issue: the German or native Jews, represented by
leading members of the American Jewish Committee, were opposed to the
calling of a congress, while the Russian or immigrant Jews, speaking largely
through the Zionist organization, clamored for it.</p>

<p>From what has preceded I believe it may be safely concluded that this
demand for a congress on the one hand, and the opposition to it on the
other, are not rooted in diametrically opposed and deeply implanted
theories of Judaism but are rather the expression of different moods or
temperaments. The immigrant Jews who were directly concerned in the
war, since its horrors affected their homelands and the kin they left behind,
and who were impulsive and sentimental, felt the burning need of crying out
in their despair, and were ready to face the consequences which might result
from this outcry. The native Jews, whose sympathy with their far-off
brethren, profound though it was, could hardly, in the nature of the case,
be more than indirect and whose accustomed reserve and self-restraint enabled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
them to judge the issues more calmly, shrunk from the risks which in
their opinion were implied in an open protest of the Jewish people before
the inflamed public opinion of the non-Jewish world. It is not my intention,
nor is it my function, to render judgment in so momentous an hour on an
issue concerning which Jewish opinion is diametrically yet honestly divided.
But it is necessary to point out that whichever side may be in the right:
serious as may be the dangers of holding a congress or not, the dangers
involved in a split over this question are incalculably more serious. Such a
split may not only result in permanent and perhaps irreparable injury to the
Jewish cause in America and to the Zionist movement in this country, but
may also, by aligning the two sections of American Jewry against one another,
spell nothing short of disaster to the Jewish people as a whole. The
stakes involved in this conflict are infinitely greater than the issue which
has given rise to it.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Structure of American Judaism Endangered</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>S</big>O far as American Judaism is concerned, the practical results of this
strife between Zionists and non-Zionists in America,&mdash;to leave aside
all theoretical considerations,&mdash;may prove to be fatal. It will reopen the
gap between the two elements of American Jewry which had been almost
filled. The work of American Judaism has been done by both elements.
Prominent non-Zionists and even anti-Zionists have frequently and gratefully
acknowledged the debt which American Israel owes to the cooperation
of the Zionists. The institutions of American Jewry depend to a large
extent for their existence upon the non-Zionists, who may now by the force
of reaction be driven into anti-Zionism. But the progress of these institutions
just as largely depends upon those who are Zionists. The withdrawal
of the Zionists from American Jewish work&mdash;and such withdrawal may become
a moral duty for the Zionists who are loyal to the movement and
respect their convictions&mdash;might mean a complete standstill in the life of
American Jewry. Perhaps there are a few among us who are skeptical
about the fate of American Judaism, and who therefore see no harm in
hastening its disintegration. But those of us who are profoundly concerned
about the future of the two and one-half million Jews who are now in
America, and of twice that number who may one day be here, cannot but
view with the utmost anxiety the danger of wrecking what promises to
become the greatest Jewish center in the history of the Jews since their
dispersion.</div>

<p>As for the Zionist movement, one cannot help doubting whether Zionism,
even if it succeeded in defeating its opponents, would thereby obtain its
object. I am not speaking of the very considerable material injury which
the movement will suffer from the indifference and hostility of the other side.
I am rather thinking of the dangers incurred by Zionism itself if, having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
repulsed the so-called classes, it becomes a one-sided movement of the
masses. Of course, no Zionist can be otherwise than deeply gratified by
the prospect of Zionism becoming a cause of the people, but unless it
manages to preserve the balance of power within the Jewish community, it
will be exposed to risks from another source. Zionism is beset with so many
difficulties that it dare not burden itself with problems extraneous to it. The
injection of political or economic issues into the movement is fraught with
incalculable consequences for the future of the movement in this country.
These issues are so extensive in their bearings and so vital in their manifestations
that if superimposed on the delicate structure of Zionism they
may crush it, never to rise again.</p>

<p>Zionism must, therefore, remain neutral. While including all Jews,
it dare not identify itself with any section of them. It dare not be either
a movement of the classes or of the masses. While holding scrupulously
aloof from the issues which divide modern Jewry as part of modern humanity,
it must keep its eye fixed on one point, the securing of a Jewish center
for the Jewish people as a whole, in which the ills that afflict humanity may
be cured in the prophetic spirit of justice and righteousness.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>A Plea for Peace and Cooperation</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE practical conclusion of these considerations is clear. It is a plea
for reconciliation, for a return to that Synthesis which was on the
point of becoming the common ground of all American Israel. American
Judaism needs peace to carry out the great task confronting it. Zionism is
no less in need of peace in order to gain the hearts of those whose hearts are
still Jewish. The very possibility of a conflict has bred a spirit of suspicion
and unfriendliness which falls like a blight upon every attempt at united
action. The non-Zionists may succeed in defeating their opponents; they
can never dispense with Zionism which is a driving force in American Jewish
life. The victory may perch on the banners of the Zionists but they can
never forego the assistance of the non-Zionists who still form the backbone
of American Jewry. Representing the common longings of the Jewish
people throughout the world, Zionism should serve as a leaven, quickening
and stimulating the Jewish activities of this country, and rescue them from
the greatest danger of Diaspora Judaism, the danger of provincialism, of
falling away from the main body of universal Israel. In the particular situation
confronting us Zionism ought to assert the claims of Palestine, in addition
to those of the Diaspora. But the Zionists cannot replace the present
agencies of American Jewish life, nor can they dispense with the cooperation
of the non-Zionists. Such cooperation, based on the synthesis
<i>Palestine plus Diaspora</i>, would be of equal benefit to both parties. Zionism
and non-Zionism have only one real enemy: it is Assimilation, which preaches
the suicide of Judaism. But all those who are concerned about the preservation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
of Judaism, in whatever shape or by whatever means, have the right to
be recognized, if not as fellow workers in Zion, at least as fellow workers in
Israel.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Supreme Test for the Jews of America</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>L</big>ASTLY, if cooperation and harmony between the Zionists and the non-Zionists
be permanently needed for the welfare of American Judaism,
they are needed a thousandfold now when the catastrophe which has overwhelmed
the ancient centers of Jewry has turned the eyes and the hopes of
the whole Jewish world toward the Jews of this country. Ever since the Jews
of Russia, fleeing from the wrath of the oppressor, began to wend their
steps toward these hospitable shores, thoughtful European Jews have been
looking upon America as the future center of the Jewish Diaspora. And as
time progressed, as the numbers and the energies of the Old Jewish World
assembled more and more in the New, American Jewry has been steadily
advancing toward this exalted position of Jewish hegemony. But what,
in the natural course of events, might have been the fruit of slow and
gradual ripening, has now been thrust upon us as the sudden result of the
World War. Crippled European Jewry is now looking, and will look more
and more, to the Jewry of America not only for comfort and support, but
also for light and leading, for spiritual advice and guidance, and the Jewry
of America, the only Jewry of consequence unscathed by the world struggle,
cannot but assume the responsibility.</div>

<p>Nor is the Jewry of America at liberty to choose. There is an ancient
Jewish legend which, with a subtle touch of sarcasm, tells us that when the
Lord, having descended upon Mount Sinai, was about to bestow the Torah
upon the Jews, the latter, shrinking from the obligations imposed by it,
made an attempt to refuse the proffered gift. Thereupon the Lord lifted
the mountain over their heads and angrily exclaimed: "If ye accept my
Law, well and good. If not, ye shall be crushed on the spot!" And the
Jews, yielding no less to the promptings of duty than to the dictates of
wisdom, quickly recanted and declared: "We will do and obey!" American
Jewry will either be the leader of Jewry or it will not be. Let it fail to
respond to the great call of history,&mdash;and it will unfailingly relapse into
the obscurity and sluggishness of its former parochialism. This great
world crisis will be either the making or the unmaking of American Jewry,
and no Jew whose mind is unclouded by the ephemeral passions of party
strife can do aught except ardently pray that the Jews of America may
emerge in triumph from their supreme test.</p>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>F a Jew of the Middle Ages, or even a Jew living
to-day in almost medieval conditions in Poland,
were present to-night,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> he would certainly say,
"What sort of a conference of rabbis is this, at which
a layman is presiding, another layman is to speak on
'The Religion of the Hebrews,' and a third layman is
to speak on a social movement?"</div>

<p>To the old-time Jew a conference of rabbis meant
a conference of men learned in the law and its authoritative
interpretation in the Talmud&mdash;men whose duty
it was to teach this law and who would confer among
themselves upon the application of its abstruse and
technical rules to the daily needs of their congregations.
But they could recognize no questions and no
problems not fully covered by that law; consequently
they could recognize no right in any person not an
authority on that law to take any part in such a conference
except to ask for the advice of the rabbis appointed
to teach the law. That was the attitude of
our ancient leaders, and it met with the full and unqualified
approval of the Jewish laymen, because it
fulfilled all the requirements of our medieval condition.
Until recent times we were a people apart, living
among the nations of the world, but not a part
of them. We had no right to join in the general civic
life. Our life consisted in the memory of a national
past and in the dreams of a national future. So far
as the present was concerned, we were perforce interested
only in the maintenance of our identity and in
the preservation of our ancient law, so that we might
be in a position some day to realize our dreams and to re&euml;stablish our national
state, founded on this ancient law. Deprived as we were of all right
to live in the present, we could justify our existence and continuance as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
separate people and a separate religion only by laying stress on the importance
of our ancient law, and striving to hand it down, pure and unaltered, to
future generations. Therefore in those days the rabbis were naturally our
only leaders, and their right to leadership depended solely upon their knowledge
of the law. The observance of the Torah embraced all the limits of the
life of the Jew.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>New Opportunities and New Obligations</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>O-DAY all this has changed. The Jew of to-day is living in the present,
and the observance of the minuti&aelig; of Jewish law is to the man
active in civic and business life of slight if any importance.</div>

<p>Inconceivable as it would be to a medieval Jew that at a conference
of Jewish rabbis a layman should preside and laymen should make formal
addresses, it would be equally inconceivable to such a Jew that among
the laymen who might make such addresses, there could be a professor at
a great university, a worker in the general social activities of the city, and
a judge. These changed conditions, this wide life now opened to the Jews,
have produced new problems, and we demand of our rabbis, if they are indeed
to remain the teachers and leaders in Israel, that they help us solve
these problems.</p>

<p>As soon as opportunities were offered to us, we eagerly grasped them.
We are too eager, too ambitious, too practical a people to continue to
live in dreams of the past and visions of the future, when the present is
thrown open to us. We have definitely and forever discarded the concept
that we are a peculiar people, the "chosen of the Lord," in so far as that
concept cuts us off from free participation in the life of the nations among
which we live, or from serving in the cause of the general advance of humanity.
We have demanded the opportunity to exercise civic rights, and
as those rights have been granted, we have recognized that the opportunity
confers also an obligation&mdash;the obligation to exercise those rights in no
narrow spirit, but for the benefit of the whole people of which we are now
a part.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Why the Jew Remains a Jew</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>S a result of this change, we no longer take our Judaism for granted,
but day by day perforce are asking ourselves three questions: What
does Judaism mean, and why are we Jews? Will the maintenance of Judaism
be of benefit to the countries in which we live and to humanity at
large? How can Judaism be maintained, since now we not only live among
the nations of the world, but the individual Jew has become a part of these
nations?</div>

<p>We have discarded, as I have said and as I firmly believe, the ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
concept that Judaism means membership in a peculiar people, the chosen
of the Lord, except possibly in the sense that we have a peculiar obligation
imposed upon us to demonstrate to the world the power and worth of a
spiritual ideal. We Reform Jews have discarded the view that in any
literal sense the Lord revealed himself unto Moses and gave unto him the
tablets of stone. The words "Hear, O Israel, the Eternal is One, the Lord
is One," are still dear to us, but many who call themselves Jews deny even
the existence of a personal God. Why then do we still remain Jews, why
do not those so-called Jews, who deny the existence of the Lord, frankly
join the ranks of so-called universal philosophers while the rest of us join
the Unitarians?</p>

<p>The answer comes not only from our heads, but from our hearts. Most
of us could not renounce Judaism because deep down in our consciousness,
aside from reason or logic, we know we are not as other men; we know we
are Jews. We hear the cry of the suffering in Belgium and we answer to
that cry because we are men and nothing human is alien to us,&mdash;but when
we hear the cry of the suffering Jew in Poland and Palestine, then the true
Jew answers that cry as the cry not only of a fellow human being, but as
the cry of a brother.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>A Nation Founded on a Spiritual Ideal</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>S Judaism then a matter of race? Are we after all and regardless of our
beliefs and special obligations, a peculiar people, perhaps even a separate
nation? The answer to this question lies, I think, in the study of our
history. For centuries past the Jew has been persecuted, driven from one
country to another, despoiled, massacred, and at best despised and forced
to live in the Ghetto clothed in the badges of disdain. All of this the Jew
has suffered and yet survived and kept his religion intact; willing at all
times to remain a man apart because he knew that in the past the Jews had
been a nation founded on a spiritual ideal; because his tradition taught
him that on the slopes of Mount Sinai, the Lord had entered into a covenant
with his fathers&mdash;and not only with them stood there that day, but also
"with him that was not there that day" but who came after them; and
that by virtue of this covenant, Israel became unto the Lord a kingdom
of priests and a holy people; and because the value of this tradition, the
force of this spiritual ideal was greater to him than the security, the right
to live and work freely among his fellow men, which he could have obtained
only by discarding his Judaism.</div>

<p>During all the centuries since the dispersal, the Jews have had a common
history, a common tradition, a common spiritual ideal, and they have
survived by reason of the force of this common inheritance. It is this common
inheritance of a past founded on a spiritual force that to-day, in my
opinion, constitutes Judaism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>America Demands Adherence to our Spiritual Ideals</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>R</big>ACIAL Judaism is in one sense, but in the sense of a race that has
stood for a spiritual ideal and is bound together by traditions of
the value of that ideal, and not simply a race that is bound together by
ties of common descent. At all times and in all places a Jew meant not
merely a descendant of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, not merely a descendant
of the people who once ruled over the promised land, but one who considered
himself bound by the covenant of his fathers, at least to the extent
that he would be true to his spiritual ideals, whatever these ideals
might be. Judaism is in that sense a racial religion, but it is and at all
times must be a religion and not simply a race. True, we now differ among
ourselves as to the content of our religion. True, many of us now deny
that that covenant which has kept alive our race and religion was ever in
fact made, but we cannot deny our history and our past. We cannot deny
that by virtue of the tradition of that covenant our fathers considered
themselves under a peculiar obligation, and that by virtue of that tradition
they sought to become a kingdom of priests and a holy people.</div>

<p>That tradition at least is our own heritage, and he only is a Jew who
recognizes the force of spiritual ideals, and by virtue of that inheritance
also for himself assumes the obligation involved in being a member of a
nation of priests and a holy people.</p>

<p>If that spiritual concept and not merely race constitutes the basis and
the essential content of Judaism, then surely the question of whether the
maintenance of Judaism will be a benefit to the country in which we live
answers itself. In all civic matters we must work and be as one with our
fellow-citizens, but America demands that each citizen give to its service
the best of which he is capable.</p>

<p>Since Judaism means the recognition of a peculiar obligation imposed
upon us by our past; since Judaism is founded upon a spiritual ideal,&mdash;adherence
to our ancient faith and endeavor to live up to our past must be
to us a source of greater moral and spiritual strength&mdash;strength that we
must bring to the service of our country.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Spiritual Value of a New Zion</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>O</big>UR problem then becomes really one of how we can maintain Judaism
and keep it alive now that it has become a part and not as formerly
the whole of our lives. Some say that this can be done only by recognizing
that we are not simply a racial religion but actually a nation, and that
we must re&euml;stablish that nation and its capital upon the hills of Zion.</div>

<p>This is neither the time nor the place to discuss such a matter. For
myself, I wish to say that if in the country where through our fathers the
world first learnt the value of spiritual ideals, where it was prophesied that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
"the law shall go forth from Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem&mdash;"
and "nations shall no longer lift up sword against nations neither
shall they learn war any more," a community of Jews shall be again established
who shall represent and contribute to the fulfillment of the prophecy,
such a community would be from a spiritual standpoint a living force to
keep Judaism alive throughout the world.</p>

<div class='center'><br />"<i>Nationally We Are Americans and Americans Only</i>"</div>

<div class='unindent'><big>B</big>UT I wish also to state that I cannot for an instant recognize that the
Jews as such constitute a nation in any sense in which that word is
recognized in political science, or that a national basis is a possible concept
for modern Judaism. We Jews in America, bound to the Jews of
other lands by our common faith, constituting our common inheritance,
cannot as American citizens feel any bond to them as members of a nation,
for nationally we are Americans and American only, and in political and
civic matters we cannot recognize any other ties. We must therefore look
for the maintenance of Judaism to those spiritual concepts which constitute
Judaism.</div>

<p>And it is the duty of our rabbis in the present just as it was in the
past to lead us and strengthen us in our Judaism. A conference of rabbis
to-day properly recognizes that Judaism consists no longer in the minute
observances of the law; that the Jewish people are asking for the inner
meaning of their religion, and not for dry formulas. In all humility as a
layman, I say to them that the Jewish people again needs to be taught that
what the Lord requires of them is "to do justice, to love mercy and to
walk humbly with their God."</p>

<p><i>The American spirit and the Jewish spirit are in entire

<i>LOUIS K. ANSPACHER,
poet and
playwright, whose most recent
plays, "Our Children"
and "The Unchastened
Woman," have won recognition
for him as one of the
most original and powerful
dramatists of the present
day. Born in Cincinnati in
1878, and educated at City
College of New York, and
Columbia University
(A.M., LL.B.), he occupied
the vestry pulpit of Temple
Emanu-El, New York, for
several years, and has lectured
on ethics and the
drama. A volume of his
poems, to be published soon,
will show more completely
the depth and resourcefulness
of the lyric power revealed
in the accompanying
verses. The portrait is from
an oil painting by Franzen.</i></div>

<div class='center'><b><big>I</big></b></div>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">The Man and His Work</span></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>T was in the little parlor of a four-room New York
flat. The room was furnished sparsely: a table
and a few chairs of bamboo, a long row of books
on the yellow floor along one wall, some Chinese ornaments
and plants, a few Russian embroideries, a rich
Persian covering on the couch, and candles&mdash;many
candles burning and flickering on their rest of saucer
or glazed clay candlestick. Our hostess seemed part
of her room; she was a Russian Jewess, decidedly
Oriental in type, rare in her beauty and still more
rare in her personality and charm.</div>

<p>Sholom Asch sat opposite me smoking his cigarette
and sipping his coffee&mdash;a big man of thirty-five,
with broad shoulders and a frame sturdy and substantial;
thick black hair, a high forehead, a characteristically
Jewish nose, a firm mouth, a little black
moustache, and deep brown eyes&mdash;eyes that at times
would seem to be unaware of anything surrounding
them, yet one felt that they saw everything and understood
everything. His complexion was that of a
ruddy boy, yet his large handsome features had the
sensitiveness which classed him unmistakably as an
artist.</p>

<p>He was talking in Yiddish. His voice was soft
and his sentences followed each other in musical cadence and beauty.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='unindent'><big>"Y</big>ES," Asch was saying, "he was the best Jew I ever met. I always
think of him as 'The Light of Damascus.' I was in Damascus last
year. The most beautiful city in the world! The houses on the winding
streets are centuries old. The people seem older than the houses. For
hours I stood in the market-place watching the camels and the asses pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
by. Some had the dust of the desert on their feet and some had mud and
dirt. Each went slowly on its way with its turbaned rider sitting still as
a figure of stone on its back.</div>

<p>"Through the kindness of a friend we entered a house on one of the
strange streets. Like most of the old houses its front was plain and unattractive.
We went through a court and on to a balcony overlooking an
enclosed garden. Such a garden I had never seen! It seemed a picture
transported from the 'Thousand and One Nights.' In the center was a
fountain of extraordinary workmanship, so inlaid with gems that after
the water had gushed out it seemed to splash down again in a shower of
ruby and amethyst. About the fountain were palms and fig trees. The
flowers were more wondrous than the jewelled water or the
many-colored
mosaics of the walls and arches.</p>

<p>"On the grass sat a grey-bearded Mohammedan. He smoked his
hookah in silence. Suddenly we heard voices. Three young women came
from the house and bathed in the fountain. Their lord and husband sat
stoically and smoked. They laughed and played in the splashing waters.
And as I watched this old man and these beautiful women, I thought myself
back in the ancient Damascus, in the city that I had thought was dead
for a thousand years.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='unindent'><big>"T</big>HAT evening I was walking in the city. Suddenly I saw a light before
me. To my surprise it was an electric bulb&mdash;the only one
in Damascus. It was fastened to the head of a donkey and illuminated a
painted advertisement attached to his back. By following the wires I
found they led to a large wholesale warehouse. It hurt me to find this
electric light in Damascus. I was still more hurt when I found that the
man who had installed it was a Jew, a Russian Jew who had come to the
city some years before.</div>

<p>"The next day I visited a shop where hammered gold and silver, for
which Damascus is famous, was sold. With the permission of the proprietor
I went upstairs to the workroom. What I saw there I shall never forget.</p>

<p>"I found myself in a long but very narrow room, dimly lighted by a
few dirty windows. In two long rows in front of two long tables sat fifty
or sixty little girls huddled so close together that they touched one another.
Each child was bent over the table and each held a little hammer.
She was tapping on a piece of metal. The tapping was never-ending&mdash;a
sharp clicking sound like the falling of hail. The children never spoke nor
smiled. Near me sat a little girl. She was not more than eight years old.
Her hammer had stopped tapping and her eyes were closed. She was
asleep. The girl next to her, evidently her elder sister, seeing the foreman
approach, pinched the child sharply. She opened her eyes and dully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
began her tapping. As I left this room of darkness my eyes were wet
with tears.</p>

<p>"I found out that only little girls were employed in this industry:
that they began when eight or nine years old. When they were sixteen
they usually were dead from the metal that had entered their lungs. The
children were mostly Jewish, for you must know that when the Jews become
part of a slow Eastern civilization they sink yet lower and become
yet more phlegmatic and listless than the people among whom they have
settled. I was indignant and asked if nothing was being done to remedy
this terrible evil. Then I was told that there was one man who was devoting
his life to freeing these children. It was the Jewish merchant who
used the only electric light in Damascus. He gave every cent he earned
to this work. He maintained an industrial school for Jewish children and
was trying to interest the Jews of the world in the movement. And then
I blessed this man's electric light. I think of him always as 'The Light
of Damascus.'"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>ND thus Sholom Asch talked. I cannot reproduce his words; I have
only tried to give the spirit of them. He talked in the finished style
of a Maupassant, with all the imagination and all the strength of that
great master. I saw then, before I had read his work, that his title of
"The Jewish Maupassant" was not extravagant. And I saw also that
here was an artist with human sympathy immeasurable, and yet not lacking
sensuous imagery and elemental strength and beauty.</div>

<p>Sholom Asch was born and brought up in a little town in Poland,
Kuttnow, near Lodz. His father was a merchant on a small scale. He
bought sheep and oxen from the peasants and shipped them to be marketed
in Lodz, in Germany, in France. He rode about the country and
sometimes took Sholom with him, whom he loved especially because he
studied so well. Sholom liked the sheep and the cattle, and he loved the
melancholy Polish landscape&mdash;mystic, fearful.</p>

<p>His father was a healthy, normal, honorable Jew; not fanatical but
deeply religious. He was philosophic toward life, he cared nothing for
money and was content without it. His mother, on the other hand, was
nervous and worldly. She was dependent on the externals of life and to
her no money was misery. There was a big house with much food, many
new clothes, much hospitality, and many big brothers and sisters; something
like eleven children. The ceremonies of the Jewish faith were observed
beautifully, the holidays kept happily. There was substance and
spirit.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>ND Sholom absorbed this atmosphere of the old religious rites, and
the paganism of the cattle and nature, and spoke little. When he
was six he was sent to the Jewish school. This was in session from eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
in the morning until five in the evening. He and the other children used
to watch the sun shine on certain spots and know the time. How they
waited for the moment of freedom, little knowing how well one of their
number was to picture for the world each intimate emotion and thought
of their imprisoned souls.</div>

<p>One day a peasant came to his house and Sholom went with him on
his wagon. That was a wonderful day; he played hookey. The next day
the rabbi, who believed in corporal punishment, expressed his views on the
matter of absence.</p>

<p>Asch was extremely clever at learning the Talmud and the old history
and philosophy of the Jews. He learned to reason from the Talmud and
to-day he says, "Art is logic. There must be an 'Urkraft' (elemental
strength) behind a man's work." And if there is one outstanding characteristic
of Asch's work, it is this elemental, this passionately strong and
elemental vein.</p>

<p>Max Reinhardt, whom Asch calls "Ein Dichter im Theater," loves
Asch dearly. In his Deutsches Theater, the most artistic and best
equipped theatre in the world, he produced Asch's <i>God of Vengeance</i>. This
was a marked success and is still a most popular play in Germany, Russia,
and in the Yiddish theatres of New York. Asch was only twenty-four
years at this time. From this play he made much money and a whole
village was made happy an entire summer.</p>

<p>Since then his income from his writings has increased steadily. Much
of his work is now translated into Russian and German, but as yet not
into English. The income from his translations far exceeds that from his
Yiddish publications, and he is able to support his wife and four children
in ease and comfort. Although he has been to America a few times during
the last six years, it is only several months ago that his wife and children
arrived from Poland and he settled here permanently.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>N important happening in the history of Jewish literature occurred
in the beginning of April. Perez, the intellectual father of the new
movement, died. Asch and Perez were deep friends. Of all living writers
Perez has had most influence on Asch, both as writer and as man. When
Asch brought him his first story, Perez gave him a volume of his poems.
He said of Asch, "A bird is breaking through the shell&mdash;who knows, is it
an eagle or a crow?" It proved to be an eagle. Perez was a revolutionist,
a poet, a dramatist, the defender of the weak, the inspiration of the
talented. A little story of his, "Bonchi the Silent," about a Jewish workingman
who never complained and who took all his misfortunes as a matter
of course, whose desires and hopes were so thoroughly crushed out of him
that on reaching Heaven and being asked by God to request what he desired
most, he said, "I want a piece of white bread every Friday"&mdash;that
story, more than any one influence, caused the formation of the "Bund<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
of the Russian Revolution." It made the <i>intelligenzia</i> of Russia feel that
it was their duty to teach the workingman to demand the earth.</div>

<p>And now since Perez's death, on Asch's shoulders has fallen the responsibility
of being the greatest Jewish writer living to-day. He is assuming
the added duty of revolutionist as well as artist. For the serious Jewish
writer is a sort of rabbi to his people. Ethically he stands for the old
Jewish ideals. To these Asch has added the beauty of paganism and the
vision of anarchistic communism.</p>

<p>In Paris once he came to a meeting of Zionists. He spoke against the
Zionist idea and was not listened to with great deference. Another writer,
Abraham Raisin, coming in shouted, "Hear! Listen to a great Jew."
Asch was given the floor and finished the speech.</p>

<p>Asch feels that only now is he beginning to drop his Jewish past as
material for his work. He is going out into the future: he is becoming
impressed with a vision of the America to be&mdash;the ideal democracy. And
his work is showing it. He is planning a poetic industrial drama, he is
finishing a gripping war play. His deep understanding of the industrial
slavery of our times is shown wonderfully in his novel, <i>Motke the Scamp</i>,
which is now appearing in serial form in the New York Yiddish <i>Forward</i>.
He begins with Motke's infancy. His mother's milk is sold to the rich
man's baby; Motke is cheated of everything. Picture after picture of
sordid Polish ghetto life follows&mdash;intermixed with wood and river sunshine
as only Asch can do it. One feels the sun resting eternally over all,
while man with his laughter and tenderness and pain struggles toward perfection.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>SCH is becoming an exposer and a prophet, but with great beauty
of style and purity of emotion. He is decidedly modern, decidedly
Russian, decidedly Hebraic, and eternally universal. He is bringing the
message of beauty and freedom to the American Yiddish working man.
Asch is not a socialist; he is a real individualist. With a sincere contribution
to the happiness of the world he believes that every human being is
entitled to all the joy of the world, no matter what form his contribution
may assume; shirts, street cleaning, cooking, a painting, dishes, a poem.
He does not preach eight hours and a dollar more, he demands joy in labor.
He wants people to play&mdash;to be happy at their work. He demands freedom
in one's personal life and beauty in mind and body. He is an industrialist
plus an artist.</div>

<p>Asch has traveled through Russia talking on various subjects to Jewish
gatherings, not for money but for love of his race. He has visited Palestine,
but with a keen interest in the growth and development of the Jew&mdash;not
from a nationalistic standpoint but from a world point of view.</p>

<p>And this is why he admires America&mdash;because it brings to him a vision
of a perfect race, the result of the mixture of all races, perpetuating the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
fine traits of all. He is immensely interested in the public school. He believes
in democracy and thinks we have it in America.</p>

<p>For artists, however, he says this country is not good. The newspapers
in Europe, he says, print what Tolstoi eats and how he sleeps. Here
Rockefeller is the national hero. The artist here lacks artistic obstinacy;
he succumbs to money, he leaves starvation and his <i>Kunst</i>.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>SCH loves Shakespere above all other writers; he is his master. For
months he went each night to the Berlin theatres and often, with his
eyes shut, would listen to the words and cadences of Shakespere's lines.
<i>Hamlet</i> he considers the greatest play ever written. <i>Midsummer Night's
Dream</i> and <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> are two of his favorites. From the ghost
scene in <i>Hamlet</i> he can trace Maeterlinck and all the modern mystics. He
says that Shakespere is universal in his appeal and that his work in translation,
when done by a master like Schlegel, takes on the peculiar flavor of
the tongue and people into which it is translated and loses none of its
intrinsic worth.</div>

<p>He loves Gogol and Tolstoi. <i>Faust</i> is one of his favorite dramas.
He loves the old masters Greco and Rembrandt; among the moderns,
C&eacute;zanne, Puvis de Chavannes, Manet. In opera he does not care for Wagner,
but he is very fond of <i>The Magic Flute</i>, of <i>Madame Butterfly</i>, of
<i>Pagliacci</i>. He loves music and the theatre. Asch reads in many languages,
German, French, Russian, Polish, Hebrew, and a little English. But to
everybody he talks in Yiddish. He has no ear for other languages except
English, which he says is like his mother tongue!</p>

<p>In the spring Asch goes out to the country and works, in the summer
he loafs, in the winter he lives among his friends. He writes all the time,
being chock full of energy&mdash;for work, for love, for friendship, for happiness.
As he says, "I am thankful to God for three things: first that he
gave me life, second that he gave me my talent, third for my love for you"
(this to whomever the lady happens to be).</p>

<p>Like all the artists he is erratic, original, attractive, all-seeing. But
unlike most he has much strength of character and a brilliant logical
faculty that makes him check up his personal relations. He has much
affection in him and a great honesty and integrity which wins him admiration
and respect, and he has many friends among many kinds of people in
many parts of the world.</p>

<p>Sholom Asch is a philosopher, a novelist, a poet, and a dramatist.
He loves the clouds and the sea, he truly loves mankind. Always through
all he writes one feels a deep and elemental strength, an elemental belief
in nature and truth. He is not ahead of his time; he is rather an interpreter
and inspirer of his own day. This makes him the happy person that
he is. He is greatly honored in Russia and in Germany, and by all writers
in Europe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Asch as a Novelist and Short-Story Writer</span></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>W</big>ITH this brief sketch of Sholom Asch the man, I shall turn to a
consideration of a few of his most important works. As Sir Walter
Raleigh, the eminent English critic, has said, the best way to form a judgment
of an author is to quote his good passages. Accordingly I have been
as liberal as space would allow in my insertion of translated passages. The
most recent works, mentioned in the early part of this essay, I shall not
treat, as it was impossible for me to procure them at the time of writing.
I shall take up each work individually before making generalizations.</div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='unindent'><i><big>D</big>IE J&uuml;ngsten</i> is a novel by Asch in which he tries to portray the character
and the influences at work on the younger generation of Jews in
Russia. The plot can be simply set forth. The younger generation is
represented by five characters of three social classes. Mery Lipskaja is
the daughter of a well-to-do Jewish manufacturer&mdash;in other words, she
is of the middle or bourgeois class. She has completed her <i>gymnasium</i>
(high-school) education and has absorbed the prevalent ideas about women
and emancipation, and a desire for higher education, for a broader life, for
St. Petersburg. Kowalski is an artist. He, like Mery, is not interested in
the class struggle; all that vitally concerns him is his art and "living."
David and Rahel Lazarus are the children of a physician who is giving his
life to the people of the "Grube" or ghetto. They have grown up among
the suppressed and impoverished Jews and they are filled with the spirit of
the revolution; David actively and Rahel passively. Mischa, the cousin
of Mery, is a member of the middle class. He has become aware of the
conditions in the Grube and his struggle lies between his middle class environmental
influence, which includes his love for Mery, and his desire to
join the revolution.</div>

<p>At the beginning of the novel Mery has just returned from the <i>gymnasium</i>.
She is oppressed and dissatisfied with her provincial surroundings
and longs to go to the university at St. Petersburg. Mischa, in love with
Mery, has also just completed work at the <i>gymnasium</i>, and they plan to
go to St. Petersburg together. The artist Kowalski now comes to the
little south Russian village and soon Mery is in love with him. Mischa is
much distressed and suffers greatly. Kowalski leaves, promising to meet
Mery at St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>The second part of the novel opens with Mischa and Mery in St. Petersburg.
The climate does not agree with Mery and Mischa arranges that
they go to a Finnish village. Here they grow very dear to each other
and Mischa is about to propose when Kowalski melodramatically appears.
Kowalski and Mery now give expression to their love. Mischa returns to
St. Petersburg but cannot pursue his studies because the revolutionary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
disturbances have closed the university. Kowalski and Mery return to
St. Petersburg soon after and are admitted to the bohemian life there.
Kowalski meanwhile has become famous. The lovers gradually grow apart
and when the revolution breaks out Mery returns to her home for safety,
leaving Kowalski never to see him again. Mischa has returned home also.
After a massacre of the Jews in the Grube in which Rahel, the sister of
David, is outraged, he sees that in marrying her lies his only means of becoming
one of the Jews whom he was so desirous of helping. So despite
the fact that he still loves Mery and she is now willing to be his wife, he
marries Rahel. Mery after a period of restlessness in the little town returns
to St. Petersburg to join the bohemian group there.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE outstanding excellence of the novel lies in its characterization.
The characters live before us and we see the workings of their
minds and emotions with remarkable clarity. The mental struggles of
Mischa between his love for Mery and his desire to help the oppressed Jews,
always inhibited by inherited powerlessness to act; the carefree, art-centered,
egotistical Kowalski; the adolescent romanticism and sympathetic
insight of Mery; the cynically idealistic and self-sacrificing Dr.
Lazarus&mdash;these constitute the real substance and artistic worth of the book. The
pictures of contemporary Russian Jewish life are of marked interest,
especially to the western reader. The following passages are descriptive
of the Grube or ghetto and characterize the condition of the poorer Jews
in the towns throughout Russia:</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The sun seldom shone into the valley. Old people lost their vision early
and the percentage of child mortality was enormous. But even those who remained
alive under these conditions were weak, sick, half crippled people;
impoverished figures with crooked legs, large heads and weak arms crept through
the streets.</p>

<p>"And in spite of everything the inhabitants never left their grave (Grube)
and made no attempt to find a better, more healthy home. A sort of sick love
bound them to their unfortunate homes, and like a curse it rested on each who
was born in the valley&mdash;that he could not free himself from it and that until
the end of his days he must eke out his sad existence there."</p></div>

<p>After the massacre Mischa walks through the Grube:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The murmur of prayers re-echoed to his ears. From the little windows
of the synagogue came the soft gleam of candles. He entered. Deep as in a
cellar, as miserable and abandoned as themselves, lay the little house of prayer
of the wretched inhabitants of the Grube. The walls were bare. The Ark
of the Covenant was hung with only a piece of coarse linen. In front of the
broken 'altar' stood an old man in a torn prayer shawl and prayed before the
small penny candles. The room was full of worshippers, all inhabitants of the
Grube. Their prayer was a groaning, and sighing, and screaming, out of tormented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
hearts. It rose up to the low ceiling and hung over them all like a
heavy black cloud."</p></div>

<p>And then Mischa knew his people:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He felt his strength to bear everything; sorrow and misery and persecution.
He saw his people doing the work of servants through the centuries,
from the farthest past to the present day. He saw the bare walls of the synagogue,
the wretched Ark of the Covenant, he heard the sad melody of their
prayers which grew to despairing screams.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He had the feeling that he
was with his people in a large ship. For eternities this ship was on a voyage
of searching. It landed at harbors always new and strange: Egypt, Palestine,
Babylon, Arabia, Spain, at Turkey, at Holland and Russia. And to-day
is also a test day for the Jews. And also this day will end, and many, many,
but the ship will always sail on, will carry them all to new harbors into the
farthest future."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='unindent'><big>B</big>EFORE leaving <i>Die J&uuml;ngsten</i>, I cannot refrain from translating two
passages concerning Kowalski&mdash;the first his longing for the open
country after his long stay in St. Petersburg, and the other his remarks
on clouds:</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"St. Petersburg had become sickening to him. For loneliness he longed,
for solitude. Solitude, with his brush behind the mountains, in the deep woods.
To see every day sun, mountains, and water! The water that pushes blocks
of ice before it, and to see the cloud shadows which camp on the wide snow
fields. To live again in the little room with his comrade the Lithuanian peasant
with whom he studied in the academy! To have no money. To eat bread;
much good black bread with honey which his comrade's father would send from
the village. For whole days to wander about and paint clouds!"</p></div>

<p>Mery discovers him at work, and looking at his painting he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Everything is clouds&mdash;the warmth that I feel, the warmth&mdash; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and do
you see the pride that such a cloud has, the pride, the formality? 'The cloud
is no small thing,' my fat professor used to say. It is no small thing to paint a
cloud, for then one must feel eternity. As lovingly as a girl's body must one
model a cloud. And warmth and pride must come to expression. To paint a
cloud means to step into Heaven, into the middle of Heaven and to see a new
world which we do not know here at all. Such a nobody as I wishes to paint
a cloud, a Heaven&mdash;wishes to have seen God and create Him anew with his little
art! That is an impudence, isn't it?</p>

<p>"There you see what I have painted. It is nothing&mdash;it is worthless&mdash;something
is lacking." He looked amusedly at the picture. "Love is lacking. So it
is as my professor with the fat belly loved to say, 'To paint a real cloud one
must love.' Yes, yes, to be able to create something good one must be in love or&mdash;do
you know what? Or to feel a great sin in one's soul. Yes, yes, with a
burning sin in one's heart one can create big things. When one has entirely
fallen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'><i><big>B</big>ILDER aus dem Ghetto</i> is a series of sketches dealing with Jewish life.
Many Jewish characters are pictured in dramatic situations but
with very little plot. The characters are all poor; fishmongers, children of
the Ghetto, a Jewish farmer, two mothers, an old married couple. A few
typical plots follow.</div>

<p>"Ein Eilbotte" is really a prose poem describing a sunrise, a
storm, and the reappearing sun&mdash;more properly perhaps a series of paintings,
of symphonic word canvases. Let me translate the opening passages:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Behind the town ruin which stands on a small hill like a national monument,
flaming and fiery rises the red of the morning and floods with its glow the
gray clouds that hang in the horizon. It brings a son of the sun into the world.
The day tears itself from the lap of the mother Night.</p>

<p>"In the little town life is beginning to stir. Here and there one sees a
peasant wagon on which the dew drops of the night are still hanging. Here
and there a Jew, eyes heavy with sleep. The show windows and house doors
are for the most part locked. For many of the inhabitants the day has not
yet begun.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This day shall be like yesterday, like to-morrow."</p>

<p>A storm rushes over the woods. The storm comes like a mighty giant that
wishes to swallow the world or it seems as though God himself were spreading
out His black mantle: "The end of the world! Neither heaven nor earth,
neither beginning nor end! Black, ominous, dull, empty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Suddenly
Heaven opens for a second.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A blinding light has torn the clouds. Stabbed
by a flaming dagger the giant dies&mdash;a confused moaning fills the air. It rains."
But the storm passes. "The Heaven is clear and blue as if nothing had happened.
The air is clearer and purer, the earth washed clean by the water."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div>"<big>D</big>IE Mutter." It is in a little Hebrew school in a small town in Russia.
The rabbi has gone to say the evening prayer, leaving the
small boys to study. Instead they begin to talk of various subjects.
Mothers are discussed and each boy praised his most highly. One pale
little chap with large eyes says, "My mother also .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." and then stops.
One of the boys laughs uncontrolledly and then there is an embarrassing
silence. The teacher returns. The little Josek, however, cannot keep his
attention on the book:</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The 'crazy Trajna' stands life-like before him. Out there at the well she
stands.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He sees her plainly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All too well he knows that dirty sun-burned
face plowed through by a thousand wrinkles, those great blood-shot
eyes with the swollen, sore lids.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"He remembers her, yes, he remembers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He was still a little boy then,
when the teacher carried him to school in his arms. He cried then and hung
tightly with both hands to the apron of his mother.</p>

<p>"Mother!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this woman his mother?"</p></div>

<p>And so the emotions of the boy are set forth in memories telling us
of his mother before she was insane and now, when she is known to all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
village as the "crazy Trajna." The time when he found her insane is
described. It was raining and he was hurrying home from school. Suddenly
he sees his mother near his father's house:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There at the corner she stands.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Trembling for cold she seeks protection
under any roof.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The boy stands as rooted to the ground, without
turning his gaze from her. The water flows in streams from his coat. She
has turned her glassy eyes on him. Slowly as though following some inner
force she comes closer to him. He is not able to move from the spot; something
unspeakable gleams in those glassy eyes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Now he feels in her the mother.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His heart beats as though to
break. Always closer to him she comes. A hot wave of blood flows through
all his limbs and rises to his head. He trembles as in fever.</p>

<p>"Suddenly all fear leaves him. He assumes a waiting position and looks directly
into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Now she stands close before him. She looks at him. Away! These eyes!
this look! He wishes to fall weeping into her arms.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To weep, yes, to
weep .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to weep and to kiss.</p>

<p>"He is in the impulse to carry out his purpose when she suddenly takes
his hand. With a quick push he tears himself from her embrace and runs away
as rapidly as he can.</p>

<p>"It seems as though she ran after him with outstretched arms and blowing
hair, always faster and faster, always grasping more heavily. It seemed to
him as though he heard her terrible voice, hoarse with weariness, calling
'Joselle,' 'Joselle' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p></div>

<p>The father has taken a new wife and the "crazy Trajna" is no longer
a member of the household but is driven about the streets. And as he
leaves the schoolroom this evening, Josek is consumed with indignation and
sorrow and resolves not to flee from his mother the next time he meets her.
On his way home he meets her. The tears flow from her eyes; when she
embraces him he again runs away. But that evening he steals a plate of
meat from his home and brings it to her. That night he does not sleep.
The next noon, coming home from school he sees Trajna standing near
the well surrounded by street urchins:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"One pulls her bonnet from her head. Another jerks at her apron. A
third tears the prayer book from her hand. Some boys cry loudly,</p>

<p>"'Hurrah! The crazy one, the crazy one!'</p>

<p>"She looks at her son in surprise. Josek can stand it no longer; he goes
to his mother and with his fists drives away the urchins that torment her.</p>

<p>"They have run away. Without saying a word Josek reaches out both his
hands. His face is deathly pale. His eyes gleam with fever. The boys
laugh.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Their loud calls press themselves to his ears.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Another moment
and the hands of his mother reach around him as in a cramp.</p>

<p>"The 'crazy one' hugs him, kisses him, now laughing, now crying. Suddenly
she clutches him and begins to dance with him. 'Hurrah! Hurrah!
The crazy one is dancing with her son!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Josek casts a confused glance at the urchins. He draws himself together,
tears himself from the embrace of his mother with a quick movement and runs
away. He does not even think of the cap which remains in her hand.</p>

<p>"Even from a distance he hears the calls, 'Hurrah! Hurrah! The crazy
one dances with her son!'"</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='unindent'><big>"D</big>ER Wunderrabbi." He is a very stupid shepherd boy. He will
not learn his Hebrew lessons nor prayers. When in the fields
he often feels near to God&mdash;and whistles. He is taken to the synagogue on
a holiday. His parents are ashamed of him. He cannot repeat the prayers
from the prayerbook, yet he feels a great desire to praise God. To the
consternation of his parents he walks to the altar, and placing two fingers
in his mouth he voices his praise in a loud, shrill whistle.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All stand as though struck by lightning. Who dared to whistle in this
holy place? The father is about to grasp the boy and lead him out, the people
clench their fists threateningly. But the rabbi turns from his place at the
east of the synagogue and asks in a loud voice, 'Where is the saint? Where
is the miracle-worker who destroyed the evil forces hanging above us, who
bored through heaven that our prayers might easily penetrate the black clouds
to the throne of God?'</p>

<p>"There is no sign of the miracle-worker. He has slipped out of the house
of prayer and with his shoes and stockings over his shoulder is running as fast
as he can toward the village."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='unindent'><big>"E</big>IN J&uuml;disch Kind." She is about to be married but will not comply
with the Talmudic law requiring married women to cut off their
hair and wear wigs. She loves her hair and will not part with it. She is
married. Weeks go by and her husband is ostracised. He and his wife
have become more and more estranged and they speak to each other hardly
at all. One day he comes home and with loving words induces her to let
him cut off her black braids.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When Chanele awoke the next morning, she looked at herself in the mirror
that hung opposite her bed. Terror seized her and she thought that she had
become mad and that she lay in the hospital. On the table near her bed lay the
dead braids. The soul that had lived in these braids when they were on her
head was dead, and they reminded her of death .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She hid her face in both
her hands and heart-breaking sobs filled the quiet room."</p></div>

<p>And there are other "Wortbilder" which I shall not treat. This book
of sketches shows Asch at his very best. For the form&mdash;one without plot
dealing with character and nature description&mdash;is decidedly fitted to the
elemental, passion-laden flow of his style. It is a great wonder to me that
these gems of artistic word portraiture have not yet been translated into
English. In my opinion they rank equal in worth with the similar work of
Daudet, Maupassant, Tchekoff and Turgenieff.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='unindent'><i>D<big>A</big>S St&auml;dtchen</i> is also a book of sketches. In this, however, the different
high points&mdash;the Sabbath eve, the holidays, the marriage
ceremony and others in Russian Jewish village life, are treated. Character
is not emphasized, although one man appears through all the sketches.
The book does not come up to <i>Die Bilder aus dem Ghetto</i>.</div>

<p>Asch is essentially a dramatist. In his sketches, in his novels and in
his stories, the dramatic point of view is not lost. His plays consequently
always move, are always full of action and tense situation. The same
elemental strength and purity of emotion that is found in his prose is
always present in his dramas. In the concluding part of this essay, I shall
touch upon five of his plays in the order of their importance.</p>

<h2>Liberalism and the Jews</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Joseph Jacobs</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote" style="width: 155px;">
<img src="images/6jjacobs.jpg" width="155" height="200" alt="JOSEPH JACOBS" title="JOSEPH JACOBS" />
<span class="caption">JOSEPH JACOBS</span>
<i>JOSEPH JACOBS (born in
New South Wales in
1854), one of our leading
scholars and men of letters;
managing editor of the Jewish
Encyclopedia; author of many
authoritative books on Jewish
subjects, including "Jews of
Angevin England," "Studies in
Jewish Statistics," "Jewish
Ideals," etc. The present article
is adapted from a chapter
in Dr. Jacobs' forthcoming
book which will deal comprehensively
with the contribution
of the Jew to modern progress.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE eighteenth century was the era of the
"benevolent despots," like Frederick II,
Joseph II, Catherine II, who adopted the ruling
principle of the Welfare-State&mdash;that the object
of government should be the good of the people&mdash;but
considered that it could only be carried out for the
people, not by them. The weakness of the principle
consisted in the difficulty of securing a heritable succession
of capable benevolence, and the collapse of
Prussia at Jena and of Joseph II's well-meant but
unreflective reforms led, in the nineteenth century, to
the triumph of the principle first enunciated in America
and carried out in France&mdash;of government for the
people by the people. The transition to the next
stage, from religious toleration to religious liberty, is
marked, as regards the Jews, by the tolerance edict
of Joseph II, in 1781, which for the first time threw
open service in the army to the Jews and placed them
to some extent on the same level with other dissenters
from the State-Church of Austria.</div>

<p>But this was still toleration and not liberty, and
it was soon cast into the background by the full religious
liberty granted by the French Revolution
in 1791, in imitation of the American constitution of 1787, which entirely
separated State and Church. The granting of full religious liberty to the
Jews had previously been advocated by Mirabeau, and though Rousseau's
influence, which was all-important in the Revolution, still retained a touch
of Genevan intolerance, Jews came within his religious requirements for
citizenship by their belief in Providence and in future rewards and punishment.
It has to be remembered that in spirit, if not in will-power or influence,
Louis XVI was of the school of the benevolent despots, and it was
he who signed the edict of November 13, 1791, which for the first time in
European history placed Jews on the same level as the adherents of all
other creeds as regards civil and political qualifications. Holland was appropriately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the first country to grant the same religious equality to its
Jews.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>The French Revolution, from our present standpoint, is the more
remarkable inasmuch as it is the only great European movement on
which Jews had absolutely no influence, direct or indirect, owing to their
inappreciable numbers and insecure position in the chief centers, Paris,
Lyons, and Marseilles. The Revolution principles spread into the neighboring
countries with the advance of the French arms. In Venice, the
walls of the original Ghetto, from which all the rest received their name,
fell at once on the entry of Napoleon's troops. No wonder they welcomed
with fervor the victories of the French troops; we can catch, in Heine,
echoes of the enthusiasm with which Napoleon was acclaimed the Liberator.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Napoleon's Recognition of the Jews</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>N</big>APOLEON'S own attitude was not so uniformly friendly to Jews. On
his way back from Austerlitz in 1805 he learnt at Strassburg of the
wide distress caused in Alsace by the exactions of certain Jewish usurers in
that province, and on his return to Paris issued edicts directed against the
Alsatian Jews, restricting their usurious activity. It is fair to add that
these enactments were obviously directed against the usury of the Alsatian
Jews, and not against the Jews in general, since they were specifically
declared not to apply to the Jews of Bordeaux in the South or Northern
Italy, then under Napoleon's control. It would indeed have been against
the whole tendency of his career to have made the Jews an exception to that
principle of the "carri&egrave;re ouverte aux talents," which was the key-note of
his whole policy, as it is logically to all war-lords. It was by no accident
that similar indifference toward the creed of their soldiers, or civil servants,
was shown by William the Silent, Wallenstein, Cromwell, William III, and
Frederick the Great.</div>

<p>Napoleon's attention having thus been drawn to the Jewish Question,
he proceeded with characteristic energy to solve it by summoning
to Paris a representative assembly of the Jews of France, Germany
and Italy, who should determine on what terms Jews could be
admitted into a modern Country-State, which had been freed from the
shackles of the medieval Church-State and only recognized a certain prerogative
in the Church to which the majority of Frenchmen belonged (the
Concordat of 1802). After summoning an assembly of Jewish Notables
for a preliminary inquiry, in 1806, a more formal Sanhedrin was summoned
in the following year, to which twelve test questions were submitted,&mdash;among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
them, whether the French Jews could regard France as their Fatherland
and Frenchmen as their brothers, and the laws of the State as binding
upon them. Further points were raised as to polygamy, divorce, and
mixed marriages; other questions related to the position of Rabbis and the
Jewish laws about usury.</p>

<p>All these problems were decided to the satisfaction of Napoleon, though
some of them aroused much searching of heart among the more strictly
orthodox. The outcome legally recognized that there was nothing in
Jewish law or faith which prevented its adherents from being legitimate
and full members of a modern State which, at that time, practically
recognized Catholicism as the State-Church. The significance of the
decision was far-reaching not alone for the Jews but for the whole European
State system; it was a practical recognition that the Country, not the
Faith, was the foundation of a nation and thus gave the final blow to the
conception of a Church-Empire, which had upheld the contrary principle.
It was not without significance that simultaneously the Emperor of Austria
agreed to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Liberalism Draws the Jews to Its Ranks</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>B</big>UT though the Jews had had no influence on the French Revolution
and no share in Napoleon's revolutionary reorganization of West
Europe, the benefit they reaped from both movements was second only to
that of the serfs. For the Jews and the serfs were the two most oppressed
classes under the feudal system still surviving. And so the Jews imbibed
with enthusiasm the libertarian principles of the Revolution and the "open
career" administration of Napoleon. They threw off with avidity most
of the shackles which prevented their joining in general European culture,
and Jewish parents of means immediately began giving their sons and, what
is more, their daughters, the secular education which would adapt them
to the careers now seemingly open to them, as publicists, lawyers, and
civil servants. When the reaction came, under the Holy Alliance, with its
attempt to revive the Church-State and the closed career of prerogative,
Jews everywhere in Western Europe joined the Liberal forces, from whose
triumph alone they could hope for a dispersal of the clouds which once
more obscured the sun of liberty in which they had basked for a few short
years. Jews soon ranked among the intellectual leaders of continental
Liberalism, and from 1815 to 1848 exercised an appreciable influence on
the course of public opinion. In particular a brilliant band of Jewish
litterateurs in Germany helped to mediate between French Liberalism and
German public opinion, and practically led the movement known as Young
Germany, which opposed the cosmopolitan tendencies of the eighteenth
century to the narrow nationalism of the Reaction and advocated the
Revolution principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity, as against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
revival of the claims of Authority and Privilege by the Holy Alliance.
Boerne and Heine, Hartmann and Saphir, Jacoby and Karl Marx, are
recognized by friends and foes alike as among the leading influences which
led ultimately to the downfall of Metternich and his school.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Salons of Jewish Women and Their Liberalizing Influence</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HEY were aided in their Liberal tendencies by a remarkable group
of emancipated Jewesses, who introduced into Germany the vogue of
the political Salon after the manner of Madame Roland and Madame de
Sta&euml;l. They were mostly from the Berlin Circle, which had arisen around
Moses Mendelssohn, and carried his tendencies towards rationalism and
culture to extreme limits. His two daughters Dorothea and Henriette,
and their friends Henriette Herz and Rahel Lewin, created salons to which
were attracted some of the more liberal spirits of the cultured world of
Berlin. Dorothea Mendelssohn ultimately married Friedrich von Schlegel
and became one of the Muses of the German Romantic School. Publicists
of distinction like Wilhelm von Humboldt and Friedrich von Gentz formed,
with Dorothea and others of her circle, a "Bond of Virtue" (Tugendbund)
which according to all appearance was named on the principle of <i>locus a
non lucendo</i>. Rahel, "the little woman with a great soul," as Goethe
called her, was even a more striking personality. She numbered, among
her friends, men of such different types as Schelling and Schleiermacher,
the Prince de Ligne, and Fichte, Schlegel and Gutzkow, Prince Louis
Ferdinand, Frederick the Great's nephew, and Fouqu&eacute;, Gentz, and the
Humboldts, and she finally married Varnhagen van Ense. She was the
first to appreciate, in its full extent, the multiform genius of Goethe, and
helped the rise to fame of Boerne, Heine, and Victor Hugo. She was undoubtedly
the most striking personality among the women of her age in
Germany, and she is nowadays regarded as one of the chief forerunners of
the Feminist movement.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></div>

<p>These salons had an air of cultured Bohemianism, which attracted
many men of rank in Mid-Europe who were beginning to be repelled by the
exactions of social gathering in which all associations were determined by
armorial bearings. A similar salon was held in Vienna by Baroness von
Arnstein, in whose mansion all the diplomats of the Congress of Vienna
met as on neutral ground. Such gatherings, while helping to liberalize
good society in Mid-Europe, also brought the position of Jews to the
notice of the ruling classes and, in many cases, aroused a determination to
repair their wrongs. You cannot accept a man socially yet refuse him the
most elementary rights politically.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>
<div class='center'><br /><i>The Liberal Leadership of Heine and Boerne</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE Revolution of 1830 brought into European prominence the two
most brilliant members of Rahel's coterie, Ludwig Boerne and Heinrich
Heine. Both had made their mark as litterateurs in the preceding
decade, but Boerne's "Letters from Paris" and Heine's "French Conditions"
(contributed to the <i>Augsburger Zeitung</i>) drew the attention of all
liberal Germany to the new hopes aroused by the downfall of the absolutist
monarchy in France. Henceforth they were the dominating voices in
arousing among the German Liberals the hope of similar liberty, while in
France itself they helped to make known to French culture the deeper
currents of German thought and literature. In particular their brilliant
wit and incisive sarcasm set the tone for the feuilleton literature of all
Mid-Europe. By their very isolation they were enabled to regard men
and affairs with a certain detachment, and both wrote with an iridescent
insolence which can only be described by the Jewish technical word
<i>Chutzpah</i>. Treitschke complained of their frequent irreverences and flippancies
but in both respects Heine, "the wittiest Frenchman since Voltaire,"
was merely following in the footsteps of his predecessor, and
Boerne, like Diderot, knew that the most effective weapon against authority
is sarcasm.</div>

<p>Under the leadership of Heine and Boerne a whole school of liberal
journalists arose in Germany and Austria, many of them Jews like Saphir
and Hartmann, and they gave a tone to Mid-European journalism which
has lasted to the present day. They thus helped to internationalize
Liberalism of the French form, with its rather vague and indefinite strivings
after liberty, equality, and fraternity, as contrasted with the Liberalism
of the English type dominated by Jeremy Bentham, which aimed at constitutional,
economic, and social reforms of a definite character. Young
Germany, as represented by Heine and Boerne, left the latter type of
Liberalism severely alone.</p>

<p>Yet in the struggle for constitutional liberty, which led to the revolutions
of 1848, Jews took a considerable part on the more practical side.
Everywhere during that critical year Jews had a hand in the upheaval
against absolutism.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Among the Conservatives: Stahl and Disraeli</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>B</big>UT Jews were not altogether unrepresented among the Conservative
forces, counting indeed two of the chief leaders, F. J. Stahl in Prussia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and Benjamin Disraeli in England. Disraeli's is the better known name,
but it is probable Stahl was equally influential. Stahl is described by Sir
A. W. Ward in the Cambridge Modern History, xi. 395, as "the intellectual
leader of the conservative aristocratic party and the most remarkable brain
in the Upper Chamber.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He largely supplied the ruling party with the
learning and wealth of ideas on which to found their claims. Their organ
was the <i>Kreuzzeitung</i>, and the party was called by its name." Bluntschli
calls him, "after Hegel the most important representative of the philosophical
theory of the State. He, in many ways, advanced political science
by his dialectical and critical ability in founding new points of view."
(<i>The Theory of the State</i>, p. 73). But Stahl's historic influence will
probably rest on his connection with Bismarck at the formative period of
his career, when the future chancellor was also a member of the <i>Kreuzzeitung</i>
party.</div>

<p>Disraeli's career and influence is far better known and need not be
further adverted to in this place. The fact that both were converts has
little significance from our present point of view, since many of the Jewish
leaders on the Liberal side had also adopted Christianity. It is more
pertinent to remark that one cannot trace their conservatism to their
Judaism since there was everything in the Jewish position of their time to
range Jews on the Liberal side. Stahl and Disraeli are, therefore, to be
regarded merely as examples of Jewish ability. There is nothing specifically
Jewish in their influence unless we regard the socialistic strain in Disraeli's
conception of "Young England" as a part of the Jewish sympathy
with the "under dog," which can be attributed to their own experiences
and to the traditions of the Prophets.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Contribution of the Jews to Socialism</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>C</big>ERTAINLY we find a strong Jewish participation throughout the
socialistic movement which, from its inception up to the present day,
has been largely dominated by Jewish influences. Although modern socialism
can be traced back to St. Simon, the whole movement would have collapsed
at the death of the master but for the organizing ability of Olinde
Rodrigues and the religious enthusiasm of his brother Eugene. A practical
turn was also given by their cousins, Isaac and Jacob Pereire, who, as
bankers, had thought out the best means of carrying out the principles of
the school into practical life. An extension of the facilities for banking
would lower the rate of interest and therefore leave more to be distributed
to the workers, while the development of railways would reduce the cost
of transportation and thus lower the cost of living and raise real wages.
Accordingly the Pereires devoted themselves, with religious enthusiasm, to
creating the Credit Foncier, and later the Credit Mobilier, and were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
chief agents in developing the railway system of Northern France, incidentally
making themselves multi-millionaires in the process, though they
never lost their enthusiasm for the socialistic ideals.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></div>

<p>Most of these left the St. Simonian Church when it diverged into the
sexual vagaries of Enfantin, though one of his creeds was, "I believe that
God has raised up Saint Simon to teach the Father (Enfantin) through
Rodrigues." Felicien David the musician, however, accompanied Enfantin
on his epoch-making journey to Egypt, during which he implanted the
idea of the Suez Canal in the minds of Mehemet Ali and Ferdinand de
Lesseps, and Gustave d'Eichthal devoted his enthusiasm and energies to
creating, out of the ideas of St. Simon and Enfantin, a new religion which
should revert to the socialism of the Prophets, while denying or ignoring,
like them, any other life than this. It is said that he consulted Heine as
to the best means of founding such a religion. "Get crucified and rise
again on the third day," was Heine's caustic reply. The socialistic tone
of J. S. Mill's <i>Principles of Political Economy</i>, which differentiates it from
its Ricardian predecessors, is undoubtedly due in large measure to his
intercourse with d'Eichthal. Enfantin's vagaries, while they destroyed
any direct practical outcome for St. Simonism, drew wide attention to its
views, and Jews helped to spread them throughout Europe, Moritz Veit
performing that function in Germany, and M. Parma in Italy. The
cosmopolitan position of Jews is seen at its best in such propagandism,
and it is not surprising that they should have been attracted by views of
which the kernel is in the Prophets of Israel, whom indeed Renan, in his
<i>Histoire d'Israel</i>, brilliantly characterized as socialistic preachers.</p>

<p>The later stages of socialism in Europe were, as is well known, dominated
by Karl Marx, who based upon Ricardo's "iron law" of wages the
imposing edifice of <i>Das Kapital</i>, for long the gospel of advanced
socialism. The brilliant Ferdinand Lassalle introduced its principles
into German politics, and the most recent stages of German socialism have
been controlled by the opportunism of E. Bernstein, while among its most
prominent leaders have been V. Adler and Paul Singer.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Struggle for Political Emancipation</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HIS participation of Jewish intellect and sympathies with the Liberal
current in European politics made Jewish emancipation a part of
the Liberal creed throughout Europe. Jews were fighting for themselves
in fighting for the general liberties, and their position in the forefront of
the struggle was thus justified by the representative principle at the root of
modern Liberalism. Jewish disabilities were the last stronghold of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
old Church-State conception, and the struggle on the side of the Reaction
to retain this fundamental principle was the more intense. If Jews were
granted full civil and political rights it could no longer be contended that
Christianity was a fundamental principle of the State (or, as the English
<i>obiter dictum</i> put it, "Christianity is a parcel of the common law").
Hence the extreme violence of the defense which seems, at first sight, out of
all proportion to the interests or numbers involved. Thus the struggle
was as embittered in Switzerland as anywhere, though the Jews there only
constituted a handful, and the traditions of the country were in favor of
toleration.</div>

<p>From this aspect the fight in England is typical. As soon as the
Catholics had obtained emancipation in 1828 (the Jews had stood aside in
order not to complicate the question), Jewish emancipation became part
of the Liberal creed, and the struggle was waged in Parliament, or rather
in the House of Lords, for the ensuing thirty years. England was the
home of toleration, and her Toleration Act, passed as early as 1689, formed
the third stage in the European progress towards religious liberty. Yet
the more conservative elements in English life fought against the removal
of Jewish disabilities because it meant the visible proof of the secularization
of English politics. It is perhaps characteristic that the Tory resistance
was mainly broken down by Disraeli, of Jewish, and by Lord George
Bentinck, of Dutch, descent.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The High Tide of Liberalism</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>W</big>ITH Jewish emancipation in England Liberalism reached its acme
about 1860. Complete civil and religious liberty was gained for
Jews throughout Western Europe during the next decade,&mdash;in the German
confederation and in Switzerland, 1866, in Austria and Hungary, 1867,
and in the German Empire, 1871, while even in Spain the expulsion order
was practically repealed and toleration, if not liberty, was given to Jews
there in 1869. By that time Liberalism, both in the French sense of liberty
and equality before the law and in the English sense of constitutional
government and free-trade, had gained its fullest triumph and had spent
its force. Its negative work had been most valuable; it had freed the
human spirit from intolerable shackles and thrown into the lumber-room
the clogging survivals of medieval feudalism. But to the human spirit
thus freed it had little instruction to give of a constructive kind; its slogan
seemed to be, "Go as you please," or, to use its own formula, "laissez
faire, laissez aller." It was rather superficial in its treatment of national
and social forces and made no appeal to the more generous imaginative
emotions. It was inevitable that a reaction should set in if only to fill
the void. Nationalism which had given vitality to France under Napoleon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and in Spain, Russia and Prussia had brought down his downfall, was
opposed to Liberal cosmopolitanism. Protection to native industry, which
had, only for a moment and in England, lost its hold, replaced free trade,
and the strong individualism of "Manchestertum" was drowned in the
rising flood of Collectivism, whether in the more formal guise of socialism
or in the vaguer tendencies of philanthropy. In none of these currents of
opinion had Jews a prominent voice except, as we have seen, in the latter,
though there they were mainly effective in opposition and criticism.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Bismarck and the Forces of Reaction</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>LL these tendencies, which may roughly be summed up as the Counter-Revolution,
found a home in victorious Prussia and a voice in Otto
von Bismarck, its representative statesman. As we have seen, his views on
the nature of the State had been influenced in his formative period by F.
J. Stahl, and his socialistic sympathies may possibly have been aroused
by Ferdinand Lassalle, but he was of too independent a character to submit
much to external influences, and the tendencies he represented, Junkertum
and Militarism, were entirely opposed to Jewish Liberalism. For some
fifteen years he found it convenient to work with the National Liberal
party, to which all German Jews belonged, and among whose leaders the
most prominent were two Jews, Eduard Lasker and Ludwig Bamberger.
But in 1878 he broke with the party and let loose the forces of "Anti-Semitism"
as a means of discrediting them. The movement, thus encouraged
by Bismarck, soon spread to Austria and was transformed in
Russia into the pogroms of 1881. In France the Royalists and Jesuits
conceived hopes of reviving the Church-State and adopted anti-Semitism
as a means of discrediting not alone Jews but also Protestants and other
opponents of Catholicism. Their adherents, the French nobility, were
especially embittered against the Jews by the bankruptcy of the Union
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, a banking establishment in which all their money had been placed
in the hope of wresting the control of French finance from the hands of the
Rothschilds. Their chief hope lay in getting control of the General Staff,
by filling its posts with young men of noble birth, trained by Jesuits. In
order to attain this they schemed to remove all Jews and Protestants from
the Staff and thought they had found a rare chance in their perverse persecution
of Captain Alfred Dreyfus. Their scheme recoiled on their own
heads, and the final result of the Dreyfus Affaire was to break the alliance
of clericalism and militarism, at least in France.</div>

<p>The Dreyfus Affaire was specially significant as bringing into play, at
one time, all the forces that have given vitality to anti-Semitism. The
New Nationalism, based not on Country but on Race and fostered by
chauvinistic anthropologists as well as historians; the revived Church<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
spirit, which sees in the National Church not so much the guardian of
Christian truth as a spiritual bond of national unity; the New Collectivism
which sees in capitalism the chief anti-social force, and the revived militaristic
spirit which glorifies war as the regenerator of the nation; all these
movements combine to regard the Jew&mdash;considered as alien, infidel, capitalist,
and pacificist&mdash;as the representative enemy. All the reactionary
forces regard a revival of the medieval Church-State as both the means and
the end of their strivings, and naturally find the position of the Jew,
both theoretically and practically, one of the chief stumbling-blocks in their
way.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Church-State versus Welfare-State</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>T remains to be seen whether the ideals of religious and political liberty,
which have been gained through so much blood and tears, will be
preserved intact against the rising forces of the Reaction and Counter-Revolution
which are, at bottom, an attempt at a revival of the Church-Empire.
The slogan "One God, one king, one people," has again been
raised, and armies that are nations in arms are in movement to the cry.
Anti-Semitism is largely the result of this reaction, and while it is dominant
in the councils of certain nations Jews must once more take up their r&ocirc;le
of martyrs to the wider truth. Nowadays however they do not fight alone,
and it is scarcely possible that in Western Europe and in lands dominated
by Western European ideals they can be reinterned into their ghetti. But
the Colossus of the North still retains the medieval ideal of the Church-Empire,
and while that controls Russian State policy Jews will have to suffer,
in All the Russias, indignities and disabilities from which they have
been freed in the lands of true civilization and religious liberty.</div>

<p>The ideal of the unified Church-State has been shattered by the assaults
of modern criticism and the growth of true religious liberty. But the
conception of all the citizens of a compact territory animated by the same
ideals still retains its attraction; only the unification nowadays is with
regard to the goal rather than to the roads that lead to it. In other
words, the Welfare-State (interpreting Welfare as spiritual as well as
material) is taking the place of the Church-State of the Middle Ages and
of Reformation times. What then is to become of the separate churches or
religious bodies which are found in profusion in modern States? That
is the sole ecclesiastical problem which the modern statesman has to face.
Except among the extreme parties, such as the Ultramontagnes, the
obvious solution would seem to be that given by the modern Federal constitution
in which each State (in this case Church) has a corporate life of
its own over which it has autonomous control, except in any case where
this conflicts with the general Federal ideals. The Jewish Synagogue may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
rightly claim its place among these churches within the State as having its
part in promoting the general welfare.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The R&ocirc;le of the Jews in European Progress</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>O</big>WING to their medieval disabilities Jews, though sharing as we have
seen in the higher life and in the commerce of Europe, were yet kept
in a kind of enclave in each of the European nations, and thus acted, both
intellectually and economically, as a separate body with distinctive tendencies
caused by their isolation and disabilities. Accordingly we are able to
estimate roughly the part taken by the Jews as a body in the various
movements which have made European civilization what it is to-day. In
all these movements (except possibly one, the French Revolution) the Jews
have contributed towards European culture while sharing in it themselves.
Their monotheistic views and liturgic practices were the foundation of the
medieval Church, both in creed and deed. By their connection with their
brethren in the East and their tolerated existence, both in Islam and in
Christendom, they helped towards that transmission of Oriental thought,
science and commerce, which had so large an influence on the Middle Ages
and led on to the Renaissance and the Reform, in both of which movements
Jews had their direct part to play. So, too, in the struggle for religious
liberty and in the different stages of toleration which lay at the root of
political liberty, Jews had their part to play, and when freed from their
shackles by the French Revolution took a leading r&ocirc;le both in Nineteenth
Century Liberalism and in the Collectivism which has now replaced it.</div>

<p>But when fully emancipated, Jews no longer acted in the European
world of ideas collectively but as individuals, often choosing opposite
ideals and in most cases applying the talents thus let free to objects apart
from the general political or religious movements of the time. Great as
has been the influence of Jews in their collective capacity on the development
of European thought and culture up to the present day, it is possible
that their influence as individuals, during the past fifty years, has been even
more extensive though less discernible, owing to the absence of any general
direction to Jewish intellectuality.</p>

<div class='center'>[<i>The second in a series of articles on The Meaning of Judaism</i>]</div>

<h2>What Is Judaism?</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Mordecai M. Kaplan</span></h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>W</big>HAT is Judaism if not an ethical monotheism? The answer
is that it is not an "ism" at all, despite the last
syllable in its name. It is a living soul or consciousness;
it is the soul or consciousness of the Jewish people. We are not interested
in names, and we should not quibble about terms; it is reality that
we are after. We want to know what is involved in being a Jew and
living a Jewish life. The main reason for our finding fault with the usual
presentation of Judaism is that it does not enlighten or inspire us. If
the term Judaism does not direct our minds at once to the living energy
that operates in the Jewish people, if it has not the power to launch
us upon the stream of Israel's active thought and spiritual striving, then
it is a word without content, and had better be deleted from our vocabulary.
We did well enough without it until very recently, and should it prove an
insuperable obstacle to the solution of our spiritual problems, we shall
have to throw it into the scrap-heap of obsolete terminology. We shall
begin to call our religion "Jewishness" instead of Judaism. The former
designation has at least the advantage of connoting consciousness, and
nothing is so important for understanding the essence of any religion as
the identification of it with a form or state of consciousness. If Jewishness
will mean to us Jewish consciousness and not merely "gefillte fisch"
or some other Jewish dish, it will serve our purpose.</div>

<p>Let us not lose sight of the main issue in these discussions. We Jews
refuse to have our life quest confined to the satisfaction of our material
needs. Our souls are hungry; and whether we call it Jewishness or Judaism,
what we want is religion that will help us get our bearings in the world,
that will keep down the beast in us and spur us on to worthy endeavor in
the field of thought and action. Under normal conditions we should find
all this in the faith of our fathers. But, unfortunately, all that most of
us know about that faith is what we acquired from some old-fashioned
"rabbi" who taught us when we were small children and who made us recite
Hebrew by the page. At home our parents would insist upon our conforming
to routine observances and ceremonies which meant nothing to
us. When we grew older and occasionally asked questions about the Bible,
we met with cold and evasive replies. No wonder that later on, when we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
entered the academic world, we grew accustomed to look upon Judaism as
out of touch with the realities of life, and far removed from the elemental
needs that agitate the masses of active, enterprising humanity. We could
see no connection between the few humble ceremonies in our homes or in our
synagogues with the social, political and industrial problems upon which
was riveted the attention of the men of light and leading. To most of us
the faith of our fathers seemed little more than a medley of needless restraints,
other-worldliness, and hostility to all progress.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Religion Indispensable to the Human Race</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>B</big>UT a change has come over us. We have begun to realize that Judaism
could not have transformed the spiritual history of mankind,
as it did, if it were the negligible and insignificant thing we thought it was.
We have been unable to discern its true character, because we did not know
how to probe beneath the outward and often unattractive surface which it
presented to us in the limited circle in which we moved. We have begun
to surmise that the Jewish life we are familiar with is nothing more than
a devitalized fragment of what, under auspicious circumstances, becomes
a life that is spiritually healthful, joyous and invigorating. We have at
last learned to take into consideration the inevitable difference in mental
scope and outlook that must mark two generations, one of which had its
life formed amidst the oppressive atmosphere of Eastern Europe, and the
other in the bracing atmosphere of America. This being the case, nothing
could be more unreasonable than to expect that the spiritual heritage be
transmitted from father to child with ease and naturalness. But who is
in a better position to smooth out the roughness and overcome the angularities&mdash;father
or child? Should we demand of our elders, who are burdened
by numerous cares, and whose lives are for the most part hurried
and difficult, that they adapt themselves to our attitude of mind? Is it not
meet that we, who still retain the plasticity of youth, make advances?
Without surrendering an iota of our own individuality we might cultivate
that sympathetic insight that would reveal the inestimable worth of our
spiritual heritage. Not merely reverence for the past, but a regard for
our own future prompts us to achieve a proper understanding of Judaism.</div>

<p>It is well to realize at the outset that the problem of religion is not
confined to the Jews alone. Every great world-faith experiences nowadays
the throes of transformation and readjustment. Mistaking them for the
final struggle, the believer wrings his hands in despair over the impending
doom, and the doubter contemplates a religionless future with a great deal
of glee. But both will be disappointed in their reckoning. Religion, as
we shall see, is entirely too inherent in human life to be dispensable. The
belief that it has served its purpose in the evolution of the race, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
it can only survive as a troublesome vestige in the organism of human society,
is based upon a misunderstanding of its function. In view of the
deeper insight into human nature that has been acquired of late, as a result
of the progress made in psychological and social research, there is
good reason to believe that a better understanding is not far distant. These
investigations have not merely led to new theories about religion, but have
essentially changed the method of approach. They have rendered superfluous
the subtleties and refinements of metaphysical arguments. A new
reservoir in human nature has been tapped, and discovered to be the inexhaustible
fount of religion.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Adaptation of Judaism to Changing Conditions</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HIS new way of looking at the problem of religion gives promise
of helping us also to get a better comprehension of Judaism. We
shall find by means of it that there is much more substantial nourishment
to the faith of our fathers than can be obtained from the tabloid form in
which the textbooks mete it out to us. The previous article on "What
Judaism Is Not"<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> did not argue that Judaism could forego such doctrines
as the unity of God, the brotherhood of man and similar principles,
or that it should glory in remaining vague and inarticulate. The main
objection to the ordinary way of conceiving Judaism was that it lacked
the means of preventing its teachings from degenerating into dull platitudes.
But if Judaism is essentially the self-consciousness of the Jewish
people, these doctrines will be viewed as some of its characteristic expressions.
As such they forthwith become instinct with life. To be a religious
Jew, accordingly, means not merely to profess the unity of God in
cold philosophical fashion, but to live over again by means of thought and
symbol the divine intuition, the backslidings, the temptations, the defiance,
the threats, the tortures and the final victory implied in the "Shema Yisroel."
The Jew who does not thrill with exaltation when he sings the
world's most stirring paean, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the
Lord is One!" is either ignorant or has the blood of a fish.</div>

<p>Whether Judaism is an ethical monotheism or the consciousness of
Israel is not merely an academic question. These two conceptions represent
widely divergent ways of dealing with the practical problems of self-adjustment
to the novel situation with which Judaism is confronted.
Whether the one or the other view shall prevail will make a difference in
the fight for existence. We protest that if Judaism will be armed with
nothing stronger than the conventional platitudes, it must succumb. By
knowing itself for what it really is, Judaism will muster new heart and
strength. The need for self-adjustment is not of today; Judaism has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
been going through that process ever since it saw the light. But during
the past hundred and fifty years, Judaism has been wrestling with the problem
of self-adaptation which both the redistribution of Jewry and the incursions
of materialistic secularism have called into being. In this comparatively
short period of a century and a half, Judaism has lived through
all that the other religions have experienced within the last three or four
centuries. If we were to compare the different stages in the process of
Jewish self-adjustment we should find them analogous to those through
which European religion in general has passed. These different steps in
the process seem to have been unavoidable because they are the concomitant
of the natural development of the human spirit. A review of the salient
phases in the self-adaptation of religion to the changing conditions of life
and thought will throw light upon the significance of that vital method of
viewing Judaism which has of late worked its way into Jewish life&mdash;for the
most part unawares.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Storm and Stress Period in Religion</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>W</big>HEN we refer to the self-adjustment of religion to modern conditions,
our concern is not with the vast hinterland of ignorance
and superstition that is still inhabited by large numbers of the unthinking of
all creeds, Jewish as well as Christian. The destiny of religion is, primarily,
in the hands of those who are in the vanguard of intellectual progress, and
as long as its place in their lives is a problematic one its future is uncertain.
Since the days of the Renaissance, religion has practically been busy
adjusting itself to the ever enlarging human experience. It was otherwise
during the middle ages, when the men of intellect threw the weight of
their influence on the side of tradition and authority. They devoted their
mental powers to the support of truths that were accepted at their face
value without further scrutiny and analysis. All the resources of intellect
were spent in interpreting the few facts they had in their possession. Many
centuries elapsed before the cry was raised for more facts; but when, at
last, the cry was answered, and new knowledge concerning the world in
which men lived began to pour in, the foundations of tradition were shaken.
Since then the religion of the intellectuals has no longer been marked by
the naivet&eacute; and self-assurance of its earlier years. Its existence has been
one of storm and stress. It has resisted all attempts to crowd it out from
the new world that man has conquered for himself, and in order to be accorded
a place in that world it has submitted to considerable change and
self-adjustment. We may note three distinct stages in these efforts of religion
to accommodate itself to life, corresponding in a large measure with
the great thought movements of the eighteenth, the nineteenth, and the
twentieth centuries respectively.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></div>

<p>The first stage in the process was the rationalistic. With Copernicus
and Galileo defeated by the Vatican, with Descartes having to defend
his orthodoxy, it seemed to the English and French philosophers
of the eighteenth century that the only way man could save his spiritual
nature from falling a prey to animalism or materialism was by consigning
to destruction the special forms in which religion existed in the established
faiths. The dreamers and the visionaries of that day, who were
moved by a sincere desire to further man's higher life, entertained the hope
that natural religion would revive with the downfall of revealed religion.
But human events have taken a different turn. Life does not adapt itself
to preconceived logical systems. The rationalistic method of adjusting
religion to life failed because it was based upon a false reconstruction of
the rise and growth of religion. However logical and plausible such a
reconstruction might have appeared, the fact that it could not be verified
by study and observation of religious phenomena invalidated the practical
inferences drawn from it.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Failure of the Rationalistic School</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>LTHOUGH by that time science had made sufficient strides to know
how futile it was to reconstruct fact by means of reason, the territory
of religion was still considered exempt from the need of resorting to experience.
The thinkers of the rationalistic age were to a certain extent
still under the dominance of the medieval regard for abstract reasoning,
and applied it to man's spiritual existence. They reasoned thus: The
human being is naturally gifted with an intuition that enables him to
discover for himself the truth about God and his relation to the world. If
man had only been left alone and had not had the stream of his ideas
muddied by outside interference, he would have continued professing a religion
that would have been both pure and simple. But human depravity
did not permit the natural religion of primitive life to continue. The
fanatics with their delusions and the priests with their love of power distorted
man's primitive faith in God. They invented dogmas and practices
by means of which they could hold the masses in subjection. In course of
time these extraneous elements came to be looked upon as the main content
of revealed religion. The various established faiths and revealed religions
were little more than wilful fabrications that were bound to crumble before
the onslaughts of reason. Thus, by bringing the established cults into
disrepute, men like Voltaire and Hume hoped to restore religion to its
original state of purity and simplicity, bare of all artificialities of forms
and institutions.</div>

<p>However superficial the rationalistic method may appear to us,
nothing but supercilious ingratitude could prompt us to disparage the
service it has rendered. The rationalists are the men to whom the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
is indebted for being the pioneers in the work of breaking down the impassable
barrier of hatred and disdain which divided the followers of one faith
from those of another. Rationalism began to lift the curse of intolerance
and persecution which lay heavily upon the human race. No one who values
the freedom to live his own life in his own way should cast aspersions upon
the influence of that school of thought. Though they argued erroneously
about the nature and essence of religion, we must not forget that they
emancipated the human soul from the shackles of spiritual bondage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, our gratitude to them cannot blind us to their superficiality
and inexperience in the matter of religion. Nineteenth century
thought, with its emphasis upon historic development, exposed the fallacies
and weaknesses of the method they employed to interpret religious phenomena.
The distinction between natural and revealed religion was an
arbitrary one, and the conception of priestly fabrications a mere figment
of the imagination. Historical research has established that all the great
world faiths or revealed religions have followed laws of development that
have been in accord with the circumstances and mentality of those who professed
them, and in that sense have been perfectly natural. Instead of
being the product of fraud and wilful deceit, the established religions were
seen to be the outcome of a healthy enthusiasm and deep sincerity. The
limitations of knowledge and experience, which marked the earlier expressions
of religious life, were, from the historical point of view, more than
atoned for by the inner worth and sincerity that had prevailed in former
days. In fact, so far did the historical conception change men's attitude
that, upon finding themselves sophisticated and torn by doubt, they looked
back longingly to former ages, when religion had brought inward calm and
serenity. As a consequence of this reaction to the disintegrating tendencies
of eighteenth century rationalism, a renewed appreciation for the religion
of the past made itself felt among the circles of the cultured, particularly
those of Germany and England, and the institutions in which the spirit of
the past clothed itself were given a new lease of life.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Historic Method Is Found Wanting</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE adoption by religion of the historic method thus represents the
second stage in its process of self-adjustment. It now appealed
to man's natural desire not to allow his past to sink into oblivion. Nothing
is so humanizing as memory. He that is engrossed only in the future and
would make it the only standard of value, he who has no patience with anything
that interferes with practical utility&mdash;and memory is certainly a
source of such interference&mdash;lacks the main ingredient of humanity and
has something beaverish about him. Thus taught the historical school during
the nineteenth century, and the rationalistic ideal that would have
destroyed the established faiths no longer held sway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></div>

<p>But while the historic method stemmed the tide of rationalism, it failed
to give back to religion its native vigor. It removed forever the stigma of
insincerity that was attached to the origin and development of the dominant
faiths; it illumined the past and incorporated it into man's spiritual life;
but it was unable to restore to religion its most important function, that of
shaping the future. The fundamental paradox which the historic method
harbors, and which has prevented it from contributing adequately to the
process of adjustment, is the fact that the spiritual experiences of the past,
which it asks us to love and revere, were at the time of their enactment not
memories, but vital responses to immediate and pressing needs. In the
past religion dealt with its own present. That at all times the past did
play an important r&ocirc;le cannot be denied; but in all effective religion it can
only be a means to an end. The historic method, on the other hand, succeeds
in nothing but in revitalizing the past for its own sake. It provides
no guidance for the future. A religion must not only write history&mdash;it
must make history. This is why the historic method has been found wanting
and has had to be supplemented by a new method of adjustment, which for
want of a better term we may designate the socio-psychological.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The New Way&mdash;the Social and Psychological Viewpoint</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>B</big>UT little attention has so far been paid to this new method of self-adjustment.
Though it is still inchoate and uncrystallized, it
forms the best part of every endeavor that makes for the rehabilitation of
religion. The remarkable feature about the new mode of adjustment is
that it did not come about directly, through a desire on the part of the
teachers of religion to make good the inadequacy of previous methods.
It was arrived at indirectly from a source that at first seemed hostile, and
to some extent is still considered so, namely, social science. Not alone
religion, but government and education, as well as history, economics and
psychology, have been revolutionized as a result of the new way of approaching
the problems of human life. So recent is the change that we
have hardly had time to appraise it. The modern point of view toward
human society has worked a change in all our thinking, comparable only to
the one which resulted when the true purport of the concept "evolution" became
apparent. The human race has lived through the forces generated by
social existence without having been aware of them, even as it went on living
for thousands of years without knowing the numerous forces that were
latent in the earth, air and sea. It will probably take a much longer time
for man to estimate at their worth the forces that are at work in social
life than it took him to perceive the forces that dominate the physical world.</div>

<p>With all that, it is now generally established that the study of any
phase of human life, whether for theoretical or for practical purposes, must
be based upon the recognition that man is not merely a social animal, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Aristotle put it, but that his being more than an animal is due entirely to
his leading a social life. In opposition to the older point of view, which
prevailed in the more materialistic schools of thought during the nineteenth
century, social science has proved that the forces that operate in human
life are not merely those that are derived from the physical environment, but
also those which are of a mental character. These psychical forces operate
with a uniformity and power in no way inferior to those of the physical
world. Social science is gradually accustoming us to regard human society
not merely as an aggregate of individuals but as a psychical entity, as a
mind not less but more real than the mind of any of the individuals that
constitute it. The perennial source of error has been the fallacy of considering
the individual human mind as an entity apart from the social environment.
Whatever significance the study of the mind, as detached from
its social environment, may have for metaphysical inquiry, it can throw no
light upon the practical problems with which the mind has to deal&mdash;problems
that arise solely from the interaction of the individual with his fellows.
The individual human being is as much the product of his social environment
as the angle is of the sides that bound it.</p>

<p>This new method of studying mental life both in the race and in the
individual has revealed not merely the true significance of religion, but
the way in which it functions and the conditions which affect its career.
We now know that those phenomena in life which we call religious are
primarily the expression of the collective life of a social group, after it has
attained a degree of consciousness which is analogous to the self-consciousness
of the individual. When a collective life becomes self-knowing we
have a religion, which may therefore be considered the flowering stage in
the organic growth of the tree of social life. The problem of religious
adjustment is at bottom that of maintaining in a social group the psychical
or spiritual energy which expresses itself in beliefs, ideals, customs and
standards of conduct. Accordingly, when a religion is passing through a
crisis, what is really happening is not so much that certain accepted truths
or traditional habits are threatened with obsolescence, as that the social
group with whose life it has been identified is on the point of dissolution.
Whatever interest we have in the cultivation of the spiritual life must go
towards conserving this kind of social energy. To have roses we must take
care of the tree on which they grow, and not content ourselves with having
a bouquet of them put into a vase filled with water. This newer conception
of the religious life is fraught with far-reaching consequences, some of
which we shall have to point out in a later article.</p>

<p>In Judaism we encounter the same three stages in the process of self-adjustment,
though less clearly defined, by reason of much overlapping.
What is known as the Haskalah movement represents the application of
the rationalistic method to the spiritual problems of Jewish life. Having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
taken place in Russia, it was bound to be delayed in its coming for nearly
a century. It received the first setback in its career when the pogroms
broke out in the early "eighties," and the Russian Government inaugurated
its policy of hounding and repression. The type which the Haskalah movement
produced is the "Maskil," a man who curls his lip at ceremony and
tradition, who lacks a sense of history and dabbles in cosmopolitanism.
Not having had the courage to be thoroughgoing in his principles, or realizing
that it was futile to be so, he tolerated what was distinctively Jewish
so long as it was kept indoors and withdrawn from public gaze. In practice,
however, "Haskalah" moved in the same direction as eighteenth century
rationalism which made for the abrogation of the historic faiths.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Judaism in the Rationalistic and Historic Stages</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>C</big>ONTEMPORANEOUSLY with the rise and development of the Haskalah
movement in Russia, Jewry in the German-speaking countries
tested the validity both of the rationalistic and of the historic method. The
Reform movement was at first, like the Haskalah movement, little more than
a diluted cosmopolitanism. A typical case is that of David Friedlander and
his friends, who began by reforming the worship in harmony with modern
ideas and the changed social position of the Jews, and ended in offering to
accept Christianity, if they would not be required to believe in Jesus and
could be exempted from the observance of certain ceremonies. Influenced
by the general reaction against rationalistic tendencies and by the rise of
Jewish Wissenschaft, the Reform movement has had to reckon with the
historic method of adjustment. But that influence has not been strong
enough to overcome its early rationalistic bias from which it suffers to this
very day.</div>

<p>The historic method was applied with far more thoroughness and consistency
by the advocates of Historical Judaism. Zunz, Frankel, Graetz,
Herzfeld, Luzzatto and Joel drew the line between adaptation and assimilation.
They laid down the principle that it was fatuous to speak of a religion
adjusting itself when it breaks so completely with the past as to be
unrecognizable. In our anxiety to have Judaism conform to the needs of
the age, we must take care lest we create an altogether new religion and
label it Judaism. Intellectual honesty demands that we give due heed to
the principle of identity, so that the sameness in our Judaism and that of
our fathers be greater than the difference between them. They therefore
applied themselves to the task of reconstructing the past by dint not of logic
and phrase-mongering, but of patient, plodding search after facts strewn
in the most out-of-the-way by-paths of literature, with the consequence that
they discovered an impassable gulf between the Judaism of history and the
Judaism of the Reform movement. We shall never be able to discharge
fully our debt of gratitude to these Jewish scholars and historians who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
have given us, in place of a few vague and detached memories, a past rich in
content and inspiration. But what they did was only to lay the foundation
of the Judaism of the future. A foundation affords poor shelter against
the hail and sleet of a bleak wintry day. Of what avail is it to keep on
forever hugging the cold foundation stones, when we should be engaged in
building the house of Israel?</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Judaism and the Jewish Soul</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>S soon as we begin to experience the need not merely of giving consent
to certain abstract truths or of contemplating the past, but
of helping to build the house of Israel as a means to our spiritual well-being,
Judaism enters through us upon the third stage in the process of
self-adjustment. This is the case with all those who rebel against the pulverizing
and granulating tendencies of Judaized Protestantisms which ignore
the "Kenneseth-Israel" in the effort to mete out salvation to the individual
soul. This is true of all who refuse to allow Judaism to provincialize itself
by applying for naturalization papers wherever it finds a habitat. To this
class also belong those who see in Zionism not what its opponents make it
out to be, a sulking, sullen Chauvinism, but a method of regeneration to
which Judaism has been led by divine intuition. Dr. Schechter, who has
contributed to Judaism the concept of catholicity, has this to say of
Zionism: "While it is constantly winning souls for the present, it is at
the same time preparing us for the future, which will be a Jewish future.
Only when Judaism has found itself, when the Jewish soul has been redeemed
from the Galuth, can Judaism hope to resume its mission in the world."
How significant the apposition in which the author places Judaism and
the Jewish soul! What a pity to spoil a poetic insight of that kind by
applying to it so barbarous a term as socio-psychological. Yet in that insight
is echoed the modern conception of religion as the self-consciousness
of the group, a conception which the very conditions of life have forced the
Jew to adopt. Whatever vitality Judaism still displays may be traced to
a general presentiment that it is a social mind and not a system of abstract
truths. We should not, however, permit such a principle to remain
merely a vague presentiment. The task that devolves upon us is to render
articulate both in theory and in practice all that is implied in the intuition
that Judaism is the soul of Israel.</div>

<i>Before the Rice Institute Menorah Society,
November 29, 1915</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>T is my privilege to welcome the Menorah
Society in the name of the non-Jewish
element and of the Faculty of
the Rice Institute. When I was requested
to do so, I accepted at once and with pleasure.
I am in hearty sympathy with the
purpose of the Menorah Society. I am a
teacher of French; but I should consider
myself unworthy of my calling if, behind
the words of a foreign language, I did not
attempt to show the civilization of a people,
their soul, their ideal. Now, what I
am attempting to do for French, the Menorah
plans to do for the traditions, the
problems, the aspirations of the Jewish
race. And although I believe that the people
which gave to the world Saint Louis,
Joan of Arc, Calvin, Descartes, Pascal,
Rousseau, Pasteur, Victor Hugo has left
its imperial imprint upon the whole of
modern civilization, yet I cannot but be
conscious of the prior and higher claims of
that strange family of whose blood Moses,
Jesus and Spinoza were born. Judaism
and Hellenism, said Renan, are the twin
miracles of human history. The artistic
and philosophical primacy of the Greeks
is not so striking as the religious primacy
of the Hebrews. The worship of beauty
is a less vital element than the undying
quest for righteousness. The whole fabric
of our culture rests on those Judeo-Hellenic
foundations. And surely a university
would be false to its name if it did not include
among its courses the study of Jewish
literature and Jewish history. The
Rice Institute is young, and will not reach
its full stature for many a decade; all
branches of knowledge cannot be taken up
at the same time. But the place which
Judaic studies ought by right to have in
the curriculum will be at least indicated
and kept in mind by your Menorah Society.</div>

<p>I heartily welcome the Menorah because,
open to Jews and Gentiles alike, it
will help us break down the barrier of
prejudices which still separates the two
elements. I have seen with my own eyes
the tragic effects of such prejudices: I was
in Paris at the time of the Dreyfus case;
I have seen how they warped the thought
of scholarly men, like Houston Stewart
Chamberlain; I have read with horror of
the Russian pogroms. You, who have
suffered for ages under the fierce contempt
and hatred of fanatics, you who
have at last reached this haven of democracy
and justice, let not the lesson of
past sufferings be lost; do not forget your
brethren still in bondage; and your brethren
are those who are persecuted, all the
world over, even as you were persecuted.
You ought to be foremost among those
who labor for equality and freedom. We
have a right to count upon you in the
fight against all prejudices&mdash;prejudices of
race and color, of class and country, of
caste and religion. The emancipated Jew
must be an emancipator.</p>

<p>I welcome the Menorah Society because,
though devoted primarily to the
tradition of your people, it does not look
exclusively towards the past. Be rightly
proud of the most unique and entrancing
tradition in the history of the world.
Cherish it, hold fast to it, as a title of
nobility. The world has no respect for
the man who does not respect himself in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
his forefathers. The call to American
citizenship does not in the least imply the
duty of forgetting that you are Jews: it
is the best Jews that will make the best
Americans. But do not be hypnotized by
your past; be worthy of your ancestors by
continuing their spirit rather than aping
their habits. Think of the problems of to-day
and to-morrow. Apply to human
affairs your Biblical test of righteousness.
Then you will find that, with a slightly
different coloring perhaps, your aspirations
are ours; our diverse evolutions, after centuries
of estrangement and conflict, tend
towards the same goal; and in the Menorah
I see a sign of the coming harmony
of sects and creeds, each remaining passionately
attached to its own past, but all
working in common towards the same
future.</p>

<p>Finally, I cannot drive away from my
thought the shambles of Europe. Your
co-religionists are fighting under all the
belligerent flags, as bravely, as loyally, as
their fellow-citizens of a different creed;
and they have suffered more heavily in
Poland than even the Belgian martyrs.
When one thinks of the carnival of murder
to which the idolatry of territorial,
political patriotism has led, one cannot but
wonder whether the Jewish people
throughout the world might not afford an
example for all to follow. In Judaism we
have tradition, culture and race dissociated
from any special habitat or from any
political form; and this nation without a
land, this nation without a king, is developing,
prospering, unconquerable. I
wonder whether the territorial state, which
has led to such monstrous aberrations, is
not a last idol and doomed to disappear as
an ethical factor; and whether the future
might not belong to universal, interpenetrating
communities;&mdash;freely expanding,
untrammelled by physical boundaries, unable
to use force, and free from the fear
of force, communities of which Judaism
to-day might be the prototype. But I do
not want to dwell at any length on a mere
hypothesis or perhaps on a flight of fancy.
I have said enough, I hope, to convince
you of my hearty sympathy with the work
of the Menorah Society. May it long
prosper&mdash;an increasing element of strength
in our Institute!</p>

<i>Before the M. I. T. Menorah Society, October
22, 1915</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE Menorah Society has appealed
to me especially because of its high
purpose. We who are not of the
Jewish race realize what an important factor
the Jews have been in civilization.
Jewish culture has played an important
part particularly here in the foundation of
New England. Puritan life and thought
drew its chief inspiration from the Old
Testament. From the earliest times Jewish
men have, been leaders in science and
letters. Among the Americans and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
English there is a growing tendency towards
a better appreciation of Jewish
ideals.</div>

<p>It is important that all Jewish men
have pride in their race. If you don't,
others will not. Some Jewish students do
not seem to realize that they have a great
inheritance. Many Jewish students with
whom I have talked have been inclined
to self-depreciation, and they also felt
that everyone was against them. In contrast,
Irish students have always impressed
me with their self-confidence.</p>

<p>Bring non-Jewish students to your
meetings. Try to increase your members.
I shall do all I can to foster and promote
your work. I would also urgently advocate
a joint Menorah banquet between
Harvard and Technology. This banquet
would not only tend to tie Technology
and Harvard students closer together, but
would be of great benefit to your Society.</p>

<p>The study of Jewish culture and ideals
will help you to think of other things than
those immediately connected with your
school work, and it will, furthermore, instill
in you a feeling of dignity for your
heritage.</p>

<br />
<i>Substance of Address before the Yale
Menorah Society, October 27, 1915</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>M</big>R. Stokes spoke of three reasons
why Jewish students of the right
type were welcome to Yale University:</div>

<p>1. <i>They showed themselves capable of
the highest scholarship;</i> the large number
of prize awards won by Jewish students
was evidence of this. The speaker expressed
the hope that some of the Jewish
students would go in for scholarly life
careers. With so many Jewish students
of high scholarship it seemed strange that
relatively few pursued graduate studies
outside of the various professions.</p>

<p>2. <i>They made their contribution to the
life and thought of a democratic American
university.</i> A university like Yale is, he
said, a melting pot of democracy. One
of its main advantages is that it brings together
Orient and Occident, North and
South, Catholic and Protestant, Christian
and Jew, and makes each understand the
point of view of the other.</p>

<p>3. <i>The presence of Jewish students at
the University tends to attract to Yale
gifts in the interest of Semitic studies.</i>
The contribution of Judaism to religious
and ethical ideals was so important that
no university could afford to fail in supplying
adequate courses of Semitic instruction.
Several recent gifts to the University
in the interest of Jewish scholarship
from prominent Jewish citizens indicates
that they had been impressed with
the fair treatment of Jewish boys at Yale.
He spoke with appreciation of a recent
gift of a rabbinic library of several thousand
volumes of large value.</p>

<p>Mr. Stokes spoke with much appreciation
of the Menorah Society because of
what it was doing in bringing together
Jewish students in the interest of high intellectual
and ethical ideals, and hoped
that it would not forget that its mission
was not only to interest Jewish students
but also Christian students in Jewish culture.</p>

<h3>Items of Interest</h3>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Death of Dr. Schechter</i></div>

<p>Solomon Schechter, President of the
Jewish Theological Seminary of America,
died suddenly on November 19. Dr.
Schechter was a member of the Board
of Consulting Editors of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>,
and from the first an inspiring friend of
the Menorah movement. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>
was shortly to have received his promised
article. Endeavor will be made in an
early issue to give worthy appreciation of
Dr. Schechter as scholar and humanist and
Jewish leader. Meantime, it may be
noted that several of his leading works
are to be found in Menorah libraries:
"Studies in Judaism" and "Aspects of
Rabbinic Theology." Attention may also
be called to Dr. Schechter's last book,
published only recently, entitled "Seminary
Papers and Addresses."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Relief of Jewish Students in Switzerland</i></div>

<p>Menorah members have sent the following
amounts through the Intercollegiate
Menorah Association for the relief
of Russian Jewish students at present
in Switzerland: $38 from the University
of Pennsylvania; $23.50 from the University
of Valparaiso; $18 from The Johns
Hopkins University; $9.50 from Temple
University (Philadelphia); and $6 from
the University of North Carolina. The
students at Harvard sent approximately
$100.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Syllabus of Jewish History</i></div>

<p>By special arrangement with the University
of London, the Intercollegiate Menorah
Association has been enabled to provide
Menorah Study Circles with a Syllabus
of Jewish History from Mendelssohn
to Herzl, prepared by ten Jewish authorities
in England as an Extension Course of
the University of London.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>New Menorah Societies</i></div>

<p>New Menorah Societies have been organized
since the opening of this academic
year at a number of Colleges and Universities,
including Alabama, George Washington
(Washington, D. C.), Rice Institute
(Houston, Texas), Temple, Vanderbilt,
and Washington (St. Louis). Menorah
Societies are now in process of
formation at a number of other Universities.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Graduate Phase</i></div>

<p>A graduate Menorah Society was organized
last year in Scranton, Pa., with
Dr. Elias G. Roos as President.</p>

<p>A number of former members of the
Menorah Society of New York University<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
organized last month into "The Menorah
Alumni of New York University," with
Louis Weinstein as temporary President.</p>

<p>A Graduate Menorah Society has recently
been formed in Montgomery, Ala.,
with Harry Weil as President.</p>

<p>A Graduate Menorah Advisory Committee
has been formed in Cincinnati, with
Mr. S. Marcus Fechheimer as Chairman.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Joint Menorah Meetings in New York</i></div>

<p>Continuing the pleasant practice originated
last year, the Menorah Societies in
New York&mdash;at the College of the City of
New York, Columbia University, Hunter
College and New York University, in
company with the newly organized "Menorah
Alumni of New York University"&mdash;held
their first joint meeting of this year
in the Auditorium of Hunter College, the
Hunter Menorah acting as hostess. It
was a most successful meeting, with an
attendance of about 700 Menorah members
and friends.</p>

<p>Miss Sarah Berenson, President of the
Hunter Menorah, introduced the Chancellor
as the chairman. The speakers
were Miss Tamar Hirschensohn of the
Hunter College Faculty, and Mrs. Benjamin
S. Pouzzner, Radcliffe, 1912. Miss
Hirschensohn drew a comparative picture
of a great Hebrew friendship celebrated
in the Bible, that of David and Jonathan,
and notable friendships in the
Greek and Latin classics&mdash;Achilles and
Patroclus and Euryalus and Nisus.
Mrs. Pouzzner spoke upon the Jewish
women of the German Salons of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The
Chancellor read communications to <span class="smcap">The
Menorah Journal</span> from Viscount Bryce
and Hon. Oscar S. Straus (see pages 281
and 297). After the speaking the Hunter
Menorah held an informal reception for
the members of the other Menorah Societies.</p>

<p>The next joint meeting of the Menorah
Societies of New York will be held at
Columbia University on Sunday afternoon,
December 26. The principal speaker
will be Mr. Louis Weinberg, artist
and lecturer at the Metropolitan Art Museum
and the College of the City of New
York. The subject will be "Culture and
Nationalism." Besides the members of
the Menorah Societies in New York,
members of Menorah Societies at other
Colleges and Universities home for their
vacation are invited to be present. It is
hoped also that a number of delegates
from various parts of the country to the
Menorah Convention which meets the
next morning in Philadelphia will be able
to attend.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>College of the City of New York</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE beginning of the academic year
1915-1916 marked the adoption
of a new policy in the history of
the C. C. N. Y. Menorah Society. During
the past five years, Menorah activities
have been mainly extensive, the purpose
being to interest as large a number of
students as possible. But now that the
Menorah has come to exert such a wide
influence in C. C. N. Y., greater prominence
is being given to work of a more
intensive nature, and emphasis is laid on
the quality rather than the quantity of the
membership.</div>

<p>Our program of Menorah activities may
be divided into extensive work and intensive
work. At the basis of the extensive
work are the public lectures which
are intended not only for Menorah members
but for the entire student body. The
first of these public lectures was held on
October 7 when Dr. Sidney E. Goldstein
of the Free Synagogue delivered an enthusiastic
and inspiring address on "Social
Service and the Jew" before an
audience of over 150 students. At the
suggestion of Dr. Goldstein a number of
students present volunteered to form a
group for the study of social problems in
the Jewish community of New York City
in connection with actual social service
work. The second public lecture, held on
October 21, was delivered by the Hon.
Marcus M. Marks, Borough President of
Manhattan. Over 200 students were
present, and about 150 more were turned
away after the doors were shut.</p>

<p>The weekly forums constitute the
second part of the extensive work of the
Society. At these Forums, talks followed
by discussions are given by members of the
Faculty, Menorah alumni and others.
The first Forum meeting of the semester,
with which Menorah activities were formally
opened, was held on September 21,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
and was led by Chancellor Henry Hurwitz,
who spoke on "The Meaning of the
Menorah Movement." Other Forum
speakers have been Professor William B.
Guthrie of the Department of Political
Science; Professor John P. Turner of the
Philosophy Department; Mr. George J.
Horowitz, an ex-president of the Menorah;
Rabbi Aaron Robison, Director of
the Y. M. H. A.; Mr. Isadore Berkson,
an alumnus and ex-president of the Menorah;
Professor H. D. Marsh of the
Philosophy Department; and Mr. Julius
Drachsler, Secretary of the School of
Jewish Communal Workers.</p>

<p>The study circles comprise the intensive
work of the Menorah and constitute its
most important activity. At these study
circles a group of not more than ten students
come together once a week for one
hour to study and discuss questions of
Jewish interest. The work in the study
circles is done entirely by the students
themselves. Up to the present, eleven
study circles have been organized and
these meet regularly every week. Some of
the subjects taken up are: Modern Jewish
Movements, Current Events in Jewry,
Schechter's "Essays in Judaism," Present
Day Problems in Judaism, Jewish Biography,
The Philosophy of Ahad Ha-'am.</p>

<p>In addition to all these activities,
"regular" meetings of the Society are
held. On the evening of October 6 the
annual smoker took place at the City College
Club, with Mr. M. S. Levussove of
the Faculty, Mr. Julius Hyman, an alumnus,
and Chancellor Hurwitz among the
speakers. On October 23 George J. Horowitz
read an interesting paper on "Judaism
and Christianity," which was followed
by a spirited discussion. On Saturday
evening, November 13, there was held
a joint meeting of the students of the day
college and of the evening college for the
purpose of organizing a Menorah Society
among the students of the evening college.
Professor I. Leo Sharfman of Michigan
addressed the meeting on "A Few Facts
About the Menorah." The men of the
night college were very enthusiastic about
the idea of the Menorah and the prospects
of a successful Menorah among them are
very favorable.</p>

<p>The membership of the C. C. N. Y.
Menorah is constantly growing, although
in every case application for membership
is always spontaneous and voluntary.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Hunter College</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>S</big>INCE its first meeting of the season,
the Hunter College Menorah Society
has more than trebled its
membership. Ten per cent of the entire
student body have joined our ranks. We
hope for even greater members before the
end of the year. Our freshman "At
Home" was pronounced the most enjoyable
welcome to freshmen given by any
society. A large audience, including several
members of the Faculty, attended our
first regular meeting, which was addressed
by Professor Israel Friedlaender of the
Jewish Theological Seminary.</div>

<p>Between our regular meetings, we hold
weekly noon-time Forums. Besides, the
three study circles organized by the Society
meet weekly and are attended by
between twenty and twenty-five members.
The Society arranged for the very successful
joint meeting of all the Menorah Societies
in the city, which was held at Hunter
on Sunday evening, November 21, with
an attendance of about 700.</p>

<p>The members of the Society have shown
their appreciation of the privileges arising
from membership not only by voting
almost unanimously to double the annual
dues but also by undertaking a catalogue,
on the basis of subject matter, of the contents
of books which might be of interest
to students of Hebraic culture. This
work will cover finally, we hope, all such
books in English and the leading modern
foreign languages and should prove a lasting
help to students everywhere.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Johns Hopkins University</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>A</big> DISTINCT Menorah revival has
taken place this year at the Johns
Hopkins University. Having for
several years led a rather aimless and
nomadic existence, the Menorah Society
has at last affiliated itself definitely with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the University. At the beginning of the
present collegiate year, application was
made to the authorities of the University
for permission to hold meetings in
one of the college buildings. The permission
was very graciously granted, and, in
addition, the Dean of the Johns Hopkins
University, Dr. Murray Peabody Brush,
accepted our imitation to say a few words
of welcome to the Jewish students at the
inaugural meeting of the Society for the
year 1915-16.</div>

<p>This meeting was held in McCoy Hall,
on the evening of October 18, and was
comparatively well attended. Dr. Brush,
in a talk that was brief but to the point,
congratulated both the Menorah Society
and the University upon the closer relations
into which the two organizations
were entering. The University must
benefit, he said, from all student activities
not directly connected with the curricula
of studies, as a more unselfish love for the
institution is thereby fostered in the student.
The Menorah Society must prove
of advantage to us, as students, in that it
tends to broaden our outlook and encourages
us to enter fields of study that we
might otherwise never approach. Finally,
the Society fulfills a definite purpose for
the Jewish students in particular by keeping
fresh in their minds all the great ideals
and achievements which distinguish their
history. The Dean closed his talk with
a hearty welcome from the authorities of
the University to the Johns Hopkins Menorah
Society. Dr. Brush was followed
by the Chancellor of the Intercollegiate
Menorah Association, who urged the assembled
students to give the Society a
strong impetus this year, now that it has
definitely found a habitat in the University.
He explained the need that is filled
in the life of the student by the Menorah
Society, and outlined a mode of conduct
for the Hopkins organization.</p>

<p>In accordance with Mr. Hurwitz's suggestion,
a study circle, aiming to take up
modern Jewish history since the time of
Moses Mendelssohn, was formed on the
spot. The Society has been fortunate
enough to procure the services of Mr.
Elias N. Rabinowitz, a member of the
Semitic department of the Johns Hopkins
University, as leader of the study
circle. The group consists of close to
twenty students and meets weekly in one
of the rooms of the University library.
It bids fair to prove of genuine good to
the students interested in it.</p>

<p>At the second meeting of the Society,
November 1, the speaker was Rabbi
Eugene Kohn, of Baltimore, whose interesting
talk on "The Elements of Stability
and Progress in Judaism" elicited warm
discussion. The Society hopes to have
regular monthly meetings, for which attractive
programs have been arranged by
the Executive Committee.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>New York University</b><br />
(University Heights)</div>

<div class='unindent'><big>F</big>ORMED in December, 1913, forced
to cope at first with many opposing
and discouraging elements, the
New York University Menorah Society
at University Heights has rapidly mounted
the ladder of success and has entered upon
a banner year. We have set two great
aims before us for this year: first, to make
the Society strong internally, and, secondly,
to bring the purposes and ideals of the
Menorah movement before the alumni of
New York University.</div>

<p>Various plans are being utilized for the
fulfillment of the first aim. The Executive
committee succeeded during the summer
in getting together an excellent list
of prominent men to lecture before the
Society on current topics of Jewish interest.
A prospectus was issued in the
first week of the college year, containing,
in brief, a discussion of the Menorah Idea,
a history of the Intercollegiate Menorah
Association, a resume of the New York
University Menorah Society, a speech by
Chancellor Elmer E. Brown delivered
before the Menorah Society, a word about
Associate membership and about Menorah
Prizes, and the program for the year.
Using this prospectus as a means of introduction
to those unacquainted with the
movement, a vigorous campaign was conducted
by a well organized committee to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
increase the membership. A doubled
membership in two weeks was the result
of this. Another means towards getting
the new men to join was the Freshmen
Reception, held on October 14, at
which Dean Bouton of the College of
Arts and Chancellor Hurwitz were the
speakers. This reception proved a great
success.</p>

<p>Besides attending the regular bi-weekly
lectures of the Society, each member is
urged to join one of the eight study circles
in modern Jewish History and Hebrew
(elementary and advanced). A well
organized committee has charge of these
study circles. It has been successful in
signing up nearly a hundred men. The
study circles are conducted by several
members who are also Seminary students
and by several rabbis of the city. These
study circles are proving of first importance
in our general plans, because it is
really in these that the men acquire a little
"Jewish culture and ideals and an independence
of thought and action in things
Jewish." Several members of these classes
have become so enthused with the newer
Jewish spirit that they devote a good part
of their time lecturing on Jewish topics to
Young Judaean organizations and Young
People's Synagogues in and about New
York City.</p>

<p>To stimulate still further individual
research and study of Jewish problems it
has been decided to offer one or two Menorah
prizes for papers on various Jewish
topics. In order to raise a substantial
amount of money for that purpose two
committees are working on separate plans.
One of these committees, by a special arrangement
with the Business Manager of
<span class="smcap">The Menorah Journal</span>, has started a
campaign to get two hundred subscriptions
for <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, thereby netting
the Society fifty dollars for one prize.
This committee, backed by the entire membership,
is gaining speed daily, and looks
forward to the accomplishment of its object
before the Convention. Another committee
is circularizing the alumni outside
of New York City to get their support.
The result of this work, though incomplete
as yet, looks most promising.</p>

<p>The above is a brief resume of our
year's plans. We realize the importance
not only of having plans but of carrying
them through successfully, as we are determined
they shall be. The work is
being done systematically, not by one man
nor by two or three men, but by an efficient,
earnest executive committee backed
by almost every man in the Menorah Society.
It is our aim to tell a pretty tale
at the Intercollegiate Menorah Convention.</p>

<div class='unindent'><big>O</big>UR annual freshmen reception this
year saw very little of the conventional
"stiffshirt" formalities, nor
did it hear much of the honey-soaked
praises of Jewish loyalty and patriotism.
Instead of this we had a simple, all-student
affair where everyone found satisfaction
in merely meeting and getting acquainted
with the rest of the Jewish students.
A short talk on the purpose of
the Menorah, several selections of Jewish
music and refreshments made up the rest
of the program. This year's Freshmen,
both men and women, are especially
promising for the Menorah.</div>

<p>At the second meeting the members displayed
an excellent Menorah spirit by
adopting a resolution to include the subscription
fee of <span class="smcap">The Menorah Journal</span>
in the membership dues and thus making
the <span class="smcap">Journal</span> receivable by every member
as a matter of course.</p>

<p>At a later meeting there was a lecture
by Professor Brooder of the Sociology
Department on "The Anthropology of
the Jew," which was followed by a general
discussion. At another meeting the
writer read a paper on the Jewish Congress
movement.</p>

<p>Our meetings have thus far been unusually
well attended and highly spirited.
It must be admitted, however, that the
work was rather spontaneous and not the
product of previous planning. This is to
be remedied soon by a plan, now under
consideration, systematizing the entire
year's work.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Radcliffe College</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE Radcliffe Menorah, which was
organized in December, 1914, did
not accomplish very much last
year; there was no study circle, although
attempts to form one were made, and
the members did little or no concerted
work. This year, however, a much
stronger group spirit is being shown. A
study circle in Jewish history, lead by Dr.
Harry Wolfson of Harvard, has been
formed; and a petition for a regular
course in Jewish Literature has been
drawn up.</div>

<p>We have had two lecture meetings.
At the first, Mr. Henry Hurwitz spoke
on the imperative need for concerted action
among American Jews in the attempt
to ameliorate the conditions among the
Jews of Europe. He said the Menorah
Society should ultimately help towards
this concerted effort by bringing home
the realization of the conditions to Jewish
young men and women who, through lack
of interest or education, have not yet become
conscious of them. At the second
meeting, Dr. Kaufmann Kohler, President
of the Hebrew Union College of Cincinnati,
spoke on Reform Judaism: its history,
meaning, and purpose. Reform
Judaism has its being, stated the speaker,
not in the desire of the Jew for an easier,
less irksome mode of cooking and praying,
but in his acute need of adapting himself
to the manners and customs of the country
in which he lives. Not only is the spirit
of Judaism not lost, it is reinforced
through the casting off of the form which
might obscure it. At the same meeting,
Mr. Frederick F. Greenman, President
of the Harvard Menorah, spoke about
the possibility of co-operation between the
Harvard and Radcliffe Societies.</p>

<p>While there are few new members of
the Radcliffe Menorah, it is expected that
the year will be an active one.</p>

third year with an enthusiastic
reception to the Freshman class. A
marked increase of enthusiasm came along
with the new members. Our Society,
which three years ago began with four
members, has now a membership of sixty,
all enthusiastic about the Menorah work.
A shingle has been designed and adopted.
A Menorah prize which was offered last
year for 1915-1916 was announced at the
first meeting and it looks as if a keen competition
will take place. Courses have
been organized in Jewish History, Philosophy
and Bible study, the feature of the
study circles being that a different member
conducts each meeting and the man
who obtains the highest mark (each student
being rated by the presiding member)
will receive a prize of a set of books. All
in all, the outlook is for the most successful
year in the history of the Tufts

<div class='unindent'><big>S</big>OMEONE once said that he could
lift the world if he could find a
place to stand on. The Menorah
Society at Michigan is still working to
rear a strong foundation which will bear
the weight of a large and beautiful superstructure.</div>

<p>Our Society began its current year with
a "Teruah Gedolah." The trumpet blast
was sounded loud and long: and the children
of Israel came out from their tents.
Through advertisement in the <i>Michigan
Daily</i>, through posters and personal contact
with the students on the campus, a
large attendance was procured for the first
meeting. Professor Sharfman was on
hand to inspire enthusiasm into the men
and women. An excellent musical program
had been provided for. The meeting
was highly successful and brought tidings
for a banner year. Some previously
discordant strings were brought to the
proper tune. There had been some friction
between the Students' Congregation
and the Menorah last year. This friction
arose for two reasons: first, some Menorah
men felt that the Congregation was
"cutting out" the Menorah, that the
Congregation was entering upon the Menorah's
field of action. Of course, there
is absolutely no reason for such an objection.
The Menorah supplies the intellectual
needs of the Jewish students; the
Congregation exists for religious inspiration
only. True enough, the two overlap
to a small degree; but not sufficiently to
be termed "encroachment." The second
reason was a technical one. The Menorah
men were greatly vexed because
the time of the Congregation conflicted
with our time. The Menorah began at
8 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> on Sunday evening; but the Congregation
did not adjourn often until 8.15
or 8.30. The Congregation itself was not
to blame, for they could not always foresee
that a Rabbi would become so overheated
in discussing the war situation
that he would ignore the element of time
in the make-up of our universe. At the
beginning of this semester we determined
to put an end to all friction, though
trivial, between the two organizations.
There is no worldly reason for discord
between the two Jewish organizations.
We held a consultation with the President
of the Congregation who assured us of
all possible support; and in turn the Menorah
assured the Congregation of support.
Indeed, the Menorah conceded a
point by moving our meeting time fifteen
minutes; and the President of the Congregation,
who is also a Menorah member,
was given the floor at the first meeting
to enlighten the audience on the meaning
of the Congregation to student life.
A goodly number of Congregation men
and women are Menorah members and
<i>vice versa</i>. The two organizations are
now working in entire harmony and we
are accomplishing the more for it.</p>

<p>Our second meeting was held on October
31. Professor Leroy Waterman, the
new head of the Semitics Department, led
the discussion with an address on "The
Religious Problems of To-day in the Light
of Early Jewish History and Literature."</p>

<p>On November 28, Mr. Fred M. Butzel,
an alumnus of Michigan and President
of the United Jewish Charities in Detroit,
led the discussion with a talk
on "Some Tendencies in the Social
Work of the Jews." Through the Intercollegiate
Menorah Association we
were enabled to procure Professor Edward
Chauncey Baldwin of the University
of Illinois to speak before us on December
12 on "Job." Also through the
Association we expect to have Professor
Julian Morgenstern of the Hebrew Union
College.</p>

<p>We have this year more members than
ever before, and they are enthusiastic.
But it is not in numbers alone that we
must put our trust. We should never
worry&mdash;I know that some do&mdash;when the
Menorah has a small meeting if only it is
successful. I think that we never had a
better meeting than when Dr. Kallen addressed
fourteen members two years ago.
Isaiah's prophecy concerning the <i>Shearith
Yisrael</i>, the remnant of Israel, applies to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
our Menorah problem. The few will redeem
the many; they will uphold the
ideals and culture of the Jewish race.</p>

<p>But no matter how successful the semester
will be, we shall only be able to say
that we have added but one stone to the
pedestal which is to be the permanent and
deep foundation of the Menorah at Michigan.</p>

<div class='unindent'><big>W</big>ITH an attendance that broke
all records, and a display of
enthusiasm and interest that
augurs well for the Society, the Minnesota
Menorah opened its year of activities
on October 1, with the annual
"Get-Together" reception. During the
evening, members of the freshman class
were introduced to members of the Faculty,
alumni and upperclass men and
women. A short program entertained the
assembly, which was followed by a brief
address by President H. W. Davis, expressing
the aims and purposes of the
Society.</div>

<p>Following the plan adopted last year of
centralizing the subjects of study and discussion,
our Program Committee has for
this year again divided the work of the Society
into two divisions. The first semester
will be devoted to a presentation and
discussion of some of the Jewish problems,
viz., anti-Semitism and certain social,
economic, and religious problems, while
the second semester will be devoted to
proposed solutions of these problems
through Zionism, Socialism, Assimilation,
etc. Students and representative members
of the community will alternate in the
presentation of the various subjects to the
Society. Greater emphasis than ever before
will be given to general discussion
by all the members of the Society at each
meeting.</p>

<p>After careful consideration, the Minnesota
Menorah has decided to withdraw
its campaign to bring the Intercollegiate
Convention to Minnesota this year, yielding
in favor of the East and Philadelphia.
We wish, however, to thank the members
of the Administrative Council who had
pledged us their support, and we take this
opportunity to announce that at this Convention
Minnesota will earnestly urge
the delegates to fix the place for the Convention
of 1916, and it is for that Convention
that Minnesota will put in its
strongest bid.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>University of Wisconsin</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE academic year 1915-16 opened
very auspiciously for the Menorah
at Wisconsin. Fully 100
attended the first meeting, at Lathrop
parlors, on October 4. Twenty-four new
members were added, swelling the total
membership to fifty-six. President
Charles A. Lebowsky welcomed the freshmen
into the Society, and explained the
broad and liberal basis upon which the
Menorah rested. Professor Dodge,
Chairman of the Menorah Prize Committee,
announced the Menorah prize of
$100 (the largest individual prize in the
University of Wisconsin), and urged all
members to try for it. The closing speech
of the evening was given by Dr. H. M.
Kallen, mentor of the organization. Dr.
Kallen spoke on "The Menorah Movement&mdash;Its
Relation to Jewish Academic
Life." After the meeting a general mixer
was held, refreshments served, and the
members became acquainted with each
other.</div>

<p>At the second meeting of the year, on
October 18, Mr. Alexander Aaronsohn of
Palestine, brother of the famous agronomist,
addressed an enthusiastic audience
upon the subject of "Jewish Colonization
in Palestine." The speaker had but recently
arrived from that land, after many
thrilling adventures, and his talk was most
inspiring. Mr. Aaronsohn emphasized
the fact that while formerly, since time
immemorial, it has been the custom, and
in fact the ambition, of every Jew to return
to Palestine that he might die there,
to-day, it was not to die, but to live, that
the Jew returned to the land of his
fathers. At the following meeting the
Society discussed the Russian situation;
Mr. Zigmund Salit gave an interesting
paper describing his own experiences in
that land of suffering. Mr. Milton Moses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
delivered an oration on "The Wandering
Jew."</p>

<p>On November 15, Rev. C. A. Greenman,
of the First Unitarian Church of
Milwaukee, addressed us on a striking
theme, "The Relationship Between Judaism
and Unitarianism." Other speakers
to follow are Justice Hugo Pam, of the
Chicago Appellate Court, Rabbi Joseph
Stolz, and Dr. Horace J. Bridges, of the
Chicago Ethical Culture Society, besides
members of our own Faculty.</p>

<p>In order to arouse even more enthusiasm
for the Menorah idea, the executive
committee has arranged to hold a number
of informal dinners. Since these dinners
are given primarily for members of the
Society, no outside speakers will be invited.
Short and snappy toasts will be
given by members, the alumni will be
called upon if any happen to be present,
and the Menorah Song will be rendered
by the ensemble. If the first dinner proves
to be successful, and there is every reason
to believe that it will, these affairs will
become an established part of the Menorah
program at Wisconsin.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Western Reserve University</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE opening of the scholastic year
1915-16 marked a radical change
in the policy hitherto followed by
the Western Reserve Menorah Society.
During the first few years of its existence
membership was open only to the male
students of the university and attendance
was necessarily small. Interest in the Society
itself began to dwindle until finally
it became clear that some radical step
would have to be taken if the Society was
to remain intact and worthy of the name.</div>

<p>Accordingly, at a meeting of the executive
committee held shortly after the
opening of college in the fall, it was decided
that hereafter membership would
be open to both the men and the women
of the university. Seventy-five students
gathered for the opening meeting held on
October 24. At later meetings, Dr. Lamberton,
of the Faculty, lectured on "The
Influence of Hellenism on Hebraic Culture,"
and Dr. Daniel A. Huebsch, noted
art critic and lecturer, spoke on "The
Neglect of the Old Testament." Dr.
Huebsch urged that inasmuch as the
Menorah Society was devoted to Jewish
study, it was the proper place for a revival
of interest particularly in Biblical
literature and other Hebrew writings.
These works were distinctively the Jews'
own and should not be neglected by them
as the younger generation was inclined
to do. Both lectures were well attended
and followed by interesting discussions.
A later meeting was devoted almost entirely
to a lively as well as an intensely
interesting discussion of Zionism.</p>

<p>The Western Reserve Menorah Society
may well look forward to a banner year.
Having overcome the obstacles that face
every new organization, we are now prepared
and eager to carry on the aggressive
work of the Menorah. Passing as we
are through a period fraught with epoch-making
events, an endless number of
problems spring up on every side, each
one clamoring for attention. Upon the
solution of many of these problems rests
the future welfare of the Jewish race.
Having been awakened to a realization of
the seriousness of the situation, the Western
Reserve Menorah Society will compass
every effort to do its share in the
movement for enlightenment and progress.</p>
